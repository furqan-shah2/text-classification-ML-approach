"Halfords have been selling Apollo bikes since 1930, and with over 80 years of heritage, it is now the number one bike brand in the UK for bikes sold – over 170,000 bikes per year and the second most recognised bike brand in the UK, with 43% recognition amongst mainstream cyclists"	Financial
"As a result, the brand is really important to Halfords, and is our second most profitable bike brand. Halfords have approximately 80% consideration from the mainstream customer, and they form the heartland of our current customer base."	Financial
"The current Apollo adult range is 3½ years old, and in real need of a refresh to match the expectations of the Halfords customer.When beginning the redesign of the complete range back in summer 2012, we had the following key objectives:  Update the visual appearance and specification of the bikes  Improve the positioning of the Apollo brand as the solution to mainstream cyclists needs  Focus on improving female specific designs  Target incremental markets, such as teen and older Mountain Bike customers  Increase profitability of mainstream bikes"	Intellectual
"Customer focus groups had informed us that bike design was as important to them as specification when choosing a mainstream bike, so we invested in making the bikes look as contemporary as possible whilst maintaining good value specification to meet the needs of mainstream cyclists. Consequently design moved away from “literal” graphics towards cleaner designs"	Intellectual
"Key learnings from customer focus groups both pre- and post-bike design was that the new range offers something for everyone, with very strong value for money. Most noticeably, the progress in female bike designs was highlighted as a success and a positive move"	Intellectual
"As part of the sourcing strategy for the new range, we widened the factory base that produces Apollo bikes. This involved developing existing factories so that they could produce higher-spec bikes, as well as building relationships with new suppliers and thus increasing our supplier base."	Intellectual
Nine of these models were launched in September 2013 to provide a new offer and marketing message for the key Christmas trading period. These models were backed with a large stockholding to ensure a strong Christmas availability. The brand sold 24% more volume in Q3 FY14 vs. Q3 FY13.The remaining models were launched between October 2013 and January 2014 to give a new range message in store for spring. This has been supported by new point-of-sale in store to highlight the newness of the bikes and the great deal for customers.	Financial

"2012, Halfords embarked on a review of their payments infrastructure with the aim of developing a long-term strategy across all payment systems and processes. Not only did we want to refresh our PIN Entry Device (PED) estate and future-proof our systems in relation to PCI DSS compliance but we also wanted to give customers a great shopping experience whilst minimising the cost of change"	Intellectual
"We identified that a managed payment service would best meet our requirements and following a comprehensive procurement exercise, selected FIS as our Payment Services Provider (PSP) partner. FIS provided PA-DSS certified EFT software (TRANSAXpay EFT) which meets the latest encryption guidelines as laid down by the PCI Security Standards Council. This software encrypts card data at the point of PIN entry to ensure no card data is held “in the clear” on the Point of Sale (PoS) system or Halfords network. Card data is routed through the FIS Payment Gateway, a PCI DSS Level 1-certified environment, for authorisation, settlement and financial reporting. When used in conjunction with certified processes, the scope and cost of PCI compliance for retailers can be drastically reduced"	Intellectual
"Following integration with Halfords BT Expedite PoS, we commenced a pilot scheme in July 2013, in a single store with 3 PEDs. After an initial 2 week period, a further 8 PEDs were added in two stores to the pilot scheme for a 1 week period. A further pilot to 43 stores and 217 PEDs quickly proved that the concept logic and the roll out strategy worked.

We also passed the milestone of providing over 500,000 cycle2work bikes to organisations across the public and private sectors since the scheme launched. This success is reflected in the latest Cycle to Work Alliance data for 2014, which reflects our strong performance and increase in cycle2work market share"	Financial
"Conscious that the majority of our products are sourced overseas, we limit our use of air freight. Where possible we ship our products which, once landed in the UK, are brought by rail to our Coventry and Redditch Distribution Centres. This year we have seen an increase in tonnes airfreighted due to improved reporting and certain sales requirements but predominantly as a result of having to airfreight 61.6 tonnes of bikes from Cambodia due to shipment delays caused by strikes immediately before the Chinese New Year shutdowns. This was an exceptional requirement for air freight and we anticipate our levels of air freight returning to normalised levels in subsequent period"	Unclassified

Increases in payroll costs, reflecting the annualisation of headcount increases in FY13 and the strengthening of the senior management team were offset by savings in recruitment costs following the move to bring recruitment of store colleagues in-house. Given the performance of the business over the period, incremental colleague incentive payments were accrued for payment."	Human
