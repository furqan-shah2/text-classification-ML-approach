The business unit was established in 2011 with the main goal to reduce the inefficiencies caused by process variations across the Group.  Our BSO support is multifaceted, increasing business efficiency by streamlining and standardising finance and human resource processes and achieving cost efficiencies. At the same time, it enables top line growth by freeing up resources for customer service and business growth initiatives. Lastly, it supports strong governance and transparency"	Intellectual

The quality  of services is very high, with an error rate of less than 0.5% in all processes undertaken. In 2015, we will embark on the final phase, which involves further extending the portfolio of processes offered through our BSO and adding more customer-facing processes, as well as broadening our geographic reach to include more markets"	Intellectual

"Working capital discipline and  free cash flow generationBuilding on last year’s historic milestone, in 2014  we continued to focus on disciplined working capital management, leading to further improvement  in working capital balance sheet position and days.  In 2014, cash generated from working capital improvements was lower than in the prior year, in line with our expectations that the pace of working capital improvement would be slowing down,  as we approach triple-digit negative working capital.  This, in combination with adverse impact from currency movements, contributed to free cash flow generation which was slightly short of our recent track record"	Financial
"Capital expenditure was lower than in the prior year, in line with lower net sales revenue and within our medium-term guidance of 5.5-6.5% of our net sales revenue.

In 2014, the decline in EU and world sugar prices accelerated. Combined with favourable PET resin, metal and juice prices, this resulted in a 5% decline in our FX-neutral input cost per case. In 2015, EU sugar prices, which we have now fully contracted, are considerably lower than in 2014. With this certainty, and stable to slightly lower  prices of world sugar, resin and aluminium prices,  we expect a bigger tailwind from input costs than  in 20"	Unclassified
