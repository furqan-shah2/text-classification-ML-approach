We achieved BREEAM Excellent at Les Terrasses  du Port, our first shopping centre development in France.  In the UK we have been working with retail customers delivering much needed apprenticeships at Highcross  in Leicester. 2014 also saw the launch of the Big Positive Weekend, our first national sustainability roadshow, which reached nine cities in over nine weekends across the  UK portfolio"	Social_Relationship
How has the team evolved to enable the business to deliver strong performance?A During 2014 we introduced a number of new initiatives and targets to support our objective of promoting diversity and inclusion within the business.

With diverse regional exposure through our portfolio of prime retailing destinations, I believe that Hammerson is well-placed to benefit from this continuing trend.

"The rents achievable at shopping centres are driven by their  size, location, demographic catchment and competing centres.  High tenant demand and low vacancy drives growth in ERV  (estimated rental value).

"Demand for outlet space is driven by retailers’ desire to sell excess inventory while maintaining brand equity. The supply of new outlet centres is limited by planning consents and the availability of excess inventory to sell.Outlet centre rents are usually directly linked to tenant sales. Sales  growth for outlet centres has been 7-9% per annum over the last five years (source: Cushman & Wakefield). Investment yields for outlet  centres are high, around 6-7% across Europe"	Financial

OCCUPIER MARKETSConsumer trends – The Considered ConsumerConsumers’ habits are evolving. Our research shows they are taking a more ‘considered’ approach: browsing; researching; and comparing for longer. The internet plays an increasing role for retail transactions and as a result when consumers visit shopping centres they expect more excitement and entertainment.	Intellectual
"Online orders now account for 11% of retail sales in the UK, up from  6% in 2009. The role of physical retail space is changing as a result. Retailers are rationalising store portfolios requiring fewer, larger, better-ranged stores to support their digital platform. Fulfillment of online orders is driving strong growth in click & collect.Retailers recognise that a multi-channel strategy is essential to meet customer needs. Physical retail space is critical for brand interaction, which is supported by the whole shopping centre experience."	Intellectual
"Retailers such as John Lewis now see more online purchases collected in store than delivered to home. The intensity of online promotional activity around Black Friday in November served to highlight the logistical challenges of servicing growing online demand. Retail parks’ traditional strengths of convenience, accessibility, free parking and proximity to food stores makes them ideal to support click & collect"	Intellectual

"TENANT DEMANDRetailers are reporting a confident outlook. A BRC survey in the UK revealed 76% of retailers expect sales to improve in 2015 compared  with last year, while 67% said their investment levels were set to increase. Administration levels of UK retailers are running lower than previous years limiting the drag which new vacancies have on rents. This retailer confidence translated into ERV growth, which in  2014 turned positive for the first time since the financial crisis, according to PMA. UK shopping centre ERV growth was 0.7% in 2014. ERV trends also reflect changing retailer demand with large prime shopping centres outperforming secondary and also smaller prime shopping centres. UK retail park ERV growth was 0.1% in 2014. As well as traditional bulky goods retailers, fashion and high street brands (eg M&S, Debenhams) are taking space in parks, resulting in higher market ERV growth at these type of ‘fashion parks’."

"OUTLOOKWith low interest rates, low inflation and lower energy prices expected to persist through 2015, consumer spending power in the UK is forecast to continue rising, driving further growth in retail sales.  The economic outlook in France is still not supportive of a definitive  upturn in consumer confidence.Driven by the continued growth of online sales and rationalisation  of retailers’ portfolios, there will be greater polarisation in  demand for premium UK retail space which favours rents across  Hammerson’s portfolio. Indexation of rents in France was 0.8% in 2014 and will be flat in 2015.

The information presented  is consistent with our management reporting systems and includes metrics prepared on a proportionally consolidated basis. However,  it excludes metrics from our investments in the premium outlet shopping sector which are shown in the previous section of the Business Review, as the Group has less day-to-day management involvement and the sector has different operational characteristics from the Group’s shopping centre and retail parks interests. 2013 figures also exclude the office properties which were sold and treated as discontinued during that year."

The highlights are an increased level of letting activity across the portfolio and the recovery in tenant sales in the UK.

"Like-for-like net rental incomeOn a like-for-like basis, net rental income generated by the continuing portfolio grew by 2.1% during 2014. UK shopping centre growth of 2.2% was driven by leasing activity, rent reviews and increased turnover rent and commercial income, notably at Cabot Circus, Highcross and Union Square. However, these positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lease expiries and tenant reconfigurations."	Financial
"Leasing activity associated with tenant rotation at the newly refurbished centres was the principal factor behind French shopping centre income growth of 2.0%. UK retail parks recovered from a flat year in 2013 to record like-for-like growth of 2.4%, again due to leasing activity and the permanent letting of space which had previously been impacted by retailer administrations."

"Lease expiries and rent reviewsOur prime property portfolio provides a secure income stream, with  a weighted average unexpired lease term of eight years. However, there are a significant number of leases across the portfolio which  will be subject to rent reviews, break clauses or expiry in the near  term. These provide the opportunity to secure additional income  for the Group, if reviews or new leases are agreed at ERV."	Financial
"Over the three years to 31 December 2017, leases with current rents passing of £78.0 million are due to expire, or are subject to tenants’ break clauses. If these were renewed at ERV, additional annual rental income of £7.4 million would be secured."	Financial
"ncluding outstanding reviews and those falling due over the next three years, leases in the UK with rents passing of £150.2 million are subject to review and, if reviewed at ERV, would generate additional annual income of £9.6 million.

"Funds raised through the bond issue and, the share placing in September, were used in the short term to repay floating rate debt on the revolving credit facilities at low floating rates of interest.

However, following the €480 million bond redemption in December, the running cost of debt fell to below 4.3%. We believe that the sterling and euro bond markets will continue to be available in the medium term to refinance existing bonds as they mature and we will access these markets as appropriate.

The same gearing covenant applies to three of the Company’s unsecured bonds, whilst the remaining bonds contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175% and have no covenant for interest cover. The calculation of these ratios includes the Group’s share of joint ventures. Hammerson’s financial ratios are comfortably within these covenants.
