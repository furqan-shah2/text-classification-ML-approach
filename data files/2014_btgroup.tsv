"Customer service deliveryWe have improved our customer service this  ear, but not b  as much as we had wanted to.  Right  irst Time  (R T) is our  e  metric for customer service (see page 61). In practice, R T means understanding what our customers need,  eeping our promises to them,  eeping them informed, and acting  uic l  to   things if the  go wrong."	Social_Relationship
"The R T measure that we report for the  ear compares the average  for the fourth  uarter with that for the  ear before. Our aim for the  ear was to recover the 4% decline in R T performance reported last  ear, but we onl  achieved a 1.5% improvement. Our service in the  ear was impacted b  the widespread storms and ooding across the   which led to record levels of faults and meant that it too  longer than normal to provide our services. In BT Global Services, R T did not increase b  as much as planned partl  as a result of a bac log of orders. We also saw a signi cant rise in demand following the launch of BT Sport in August. This put pressure on our contact centre resources, which a ected the levels of service some customers received.Our strateg  begins with customer service deliver , so we are disappointed with an  setbac s in our  ualit  of service, whatever the reason. We received some bad press on customer service during the  ear and we did let some customers down. We apologised where we had done so"	Social_Relationship
"Customer e pectations are changing.  ouseholds are increasingl  reliant on their  ed-lines for access to the internet. Their e pectations around service continuit  and reliabilit  have therefore risen. We have not alwa s ept pace with this change. And our processes have also not been good enough. We are therefore ma ing further investments in our s stems, our people and technolog  and in the resilience of our networ s."	Intellectual

"We have continued to focus on end-to-end (e2e) processes which span our lines of business. The creation of a central team to implement all e2e and comple  programmes has improved our abilit  to deliver them. Speci c e2e programmes included  moving all of our access circuit data records onto a single database and ma ing sure the data is accurate. Across our global networ  we have moved access circuits onto more cost-e ective solutions and improved the processes for circuit ceases and customer  uotes  replicating the forensic approach we used in our   businesses to improve process e cienc , reduce cost of failure and improve supplier value-for-mone  in Continental  urope  and  identif ing a number of improvements to the wa  we deliver  thernet services, reducing provision time and failures in the process."

"uring the  ear, we introduced the  Continuous Improvement  (CI) initiative which we outlined in last  ear s Annual Report. This gives our people the tools for team-based problem solving to improve the processes around them. 7,000 full-time emplo ees have now been through a CI  wave , which is t picall  a 12-wee  programme. Initial results have shown improvements in e cienc , customer service and emplo ee engagement"	Intellectual
"We continue to benchmar  our cost structure against other large telecoms operators.

"What sets us apartOur business model starts with the things that set us apart from our competitors. We have a uni ue combination of people, technology and networks which we bring together to create and deliver our products and services. And we have the  nancial strength to invest in all of these to make sure we stay ahead of the competition"	Intellectual
Our people are key to the success of our business. You can  nd more on their skills and capabilities and the investments we are making in them on page 24. The assets and resources that help us deliver our strategy and support our business model are described on page 26.We make money by selling our products and services in the UK and around the world through our customer-facing lines of business. Our products range from telephony and broadband services for UK households through to managing the networks and communications needs of some of the world s largest multinational companie	Intellectual
"We sell through a range of channels including online, contact centres and desk or  eld-based account managers. Our revenue is mostly subscription or contract-based.  eople, households and SM s pay for standalone or bundled services on a monthly,  uarterly or annual basis (typically on 12-24 month contracts).  arge corporate and public sector customers usually buy managed networked IT services on contracts spanning several years. Contract durations with our wholesale customers range from just one month for regulated products, to  ve years or more for major managed services deals."	Intellectual
"Delivering valueThe three foundations of our strategy   customer service delivery,  cost transformation and investing for the future   are central to our business model"	Intellectual
Good customer service helps cost transformation. Reducing the number of times things go wrong means the service we provide to our customers is better and we spend less time and money putting things right. The savings from transforming our costs are used to make long-term investments in the future of our business and in the things that set us apart from our competitors.	Intellectual
"The cash we generate from selling our products and services gives us the nancial strength to reward our shareholders. It allows us to reward our people and ful l our  nancial obligations to our pension scheme, our suppliers and our lender"	Financial
"But it is not just about the  nancial value that we create. What we do matters. We make connections, create new possibilities and deliver value to individuals, families, businesses, our communities, and society in general. We help millions of people communicate, be entertained, do business and generally live their lives. In doing so, we ful l our purpose of using the power of communications to make a better world."	Intellectual
"We believe our business model is sustainableWe see more and more demand for our products and services because they play such an integral role in modern life.owever, communications markets are very competitive, particularly in the UK. We make sure we are on top of market and competitive trends through dedicated  insight  teams. Our  nterprise Risk Management framework (see page 50) helps us identify and mitigate the challenges and risks we face. And we use governance committees to make sure that the investments we make are appropriate and will deliver products and services that are attractive to customers.We are con dent our business model is sustainable and that we will be able to deliver value both today and in the future."

It then transmits it over our broadband network, the UK s digital terrestrial T  network and Sky s satellite platform. Our T  platform also includes the BT Sport ordering, monitoring, fault management and billing systems.As we have brought in new technologies and won outsourced contracts with major customers, the number of platforms we manage has grown. We shut down those we no longer need, moving our customers onto our strategic systems, such as our MP S platform.

This means customer expectations have risen around the time taken to install, upgrade or repair their line. Ofcom is proposing to introduce minimum service levels around the repair and provision of lines.Although we have made progress improving some aspects of our service, we have not always kept pace with customers  shifting expectations.  The main area where we did improve was in providing new lines to homes and businesses.
