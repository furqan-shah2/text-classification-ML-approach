We will achieve this by focusing on the needs of our customers and the societies we serve, thereby delivering long-term sustainable value to all our stakeholders. In 2013, we announced a set of three interconnected and equally weighted priorities for 2014 to 2016 to help us deliver our strategy: –  grow the business and dividends; –  implement Global Standards; and –  streamline processes and procedures. Each priority is complementary and underpinned by initiatives being undertaken within our day-to-day business.

Concerns over deflationary trends, particularly in the eurozone, grew. Although China delivered growth which comfortably surpassed all other major economies, expectations of slower growth in the future weighed heavily on market sentiment and contributed to significant commodity price falls and further curtailment of global investment spending"	Unclassified

"Cost progression continued globally in large part to implement regulatory change and enhance risk controls, notably around financial system integrity and conduct.

Building the required analytical capabilities entails considerable investment in systems and in maintaining customer data which is accurate and up to date. Reconfiguring customer and transactional data to the digital age is no small endeavour given legacy systems and a multiplicity of historical data standards globally.	Intellectual

"This can be seen most markedly in our Commercial Banking business, which delivered a record year buoyed by the expansion of supply chain management solutions and increasing cross-border payment flows."	Intellectual
"Our network coverage of the countries which originate more than 85% of the world’s payment activity drives this key element of our business model. On the investment side, throughout our network we saw corporate flows continuing to target the higher growth emerging markets. At the same time, growth in outward investment from mainland China accelerated as its major companies sought diversification and access to both skill bases and markets"	Intellectual
"These trends played to HSBC’s scale and presence in the key financial centres, allowing us to support customers with debt and equity financing solutions, offering tailored liquidity and transactional banking support and providing risk management solutions primarily against our clients’ interest rate and foreign exchange exposures"	Financial
"Success was evidenced by growing recognition in industry awards, the most important of which are referred to in the Group Chief Executive’s Review.

Regulatory landscape becomes clearer but still much to do A great deal of progress was made during 2014 to finalise the framework under which globally systemic banks like HSBC will be required to operate when it is fully implemented.

Swiss Private Bank The recent disclosures around unacceptable historical practices and behaviour within the Swiss private bank remind us of how much there still is to do and how far society’s expectations have changed in terms of banks’ responsibilities.

These include requiring the local incorporation of banks or ring-fencing of certain businesses. In the UK, ring-fencing legislation has been enacted requiring the separation of retail and small and medium-sized enterprise (‘SME’) deposits from trading activity (see below). Similar requirements have been introduced or are in the process of being introduced in other jurisdictions"	Unclassified
"Policy background to recovery and resolution Following the financial crisis, G20 leaders requested that the Financial Stability Board (‘FSB’) establish more effective arrangements for the recovery and resolution of 28 (now 30) designated Global Systemically Important Banks (‘G-SIBs’), resulting in a series of policy recommendations in relation to recovery and resolution planning, cross-border co-operation agreements and measures to mitigate obstacles to resolution.

The ServCo group will be separately capitalised and funded to ensure continuity of services in resolution.

The ring-fenced deposit taking entity would be subject to separation from the trading entity including requirements for separate capital and management structures, issuance of own debt and arms-length transactions between entities. The draft proposals contain a provision which would permit derogation by member states that have implemented their own structural reform legislation, subject to meeting certain conditions.

To allow for investment in growth initiatives and to reflect the increasing requirements involved in operating as a global bank, we revised the CER target to the mid-50s, adding that revenues must grow faster than costs (‘positive jaws’).

These documents can be found online at hsbc.com/sus-risk"	Natural
"Forestry policy The new forestry policy, issued in March 2014, requires forestry customers to gain 100% certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (‘FSC’) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (‘PEFC’) in high risk countries by 31 December 2014. Certification requires that customers are operating legally and sustainably."	Natural

"Agricultural commodities policy The new agricultural commodities policy requires palm oil customers to become members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (‘RSPO’) by 30 June 2014, to have at least one operation certified by the end of 2014 and all operations by the end of 2018"	Natural
"A number of customer relationships will be closed where the deadline has not been met. Other customers have succeeded in joining the RSPO and having at least one operation certified by the end of 2014. One example is an Indonesian processing, refining and export company. HSBC started to engage with this and other companies in January 2014 on the changes and continued to offer advice. The management of the company sought expert advice from third parties to understand more about RSPO certification, which they found was less complex than they had imagined. Two units of the company obtained RSPO certification in June 2014, and one further is planned"	Social_Relationship
"In order to encourage the shift towards sustainable palm oil we have introduced a discounted prepayment export finance product for trade flows of certified sustainable palm oil. This structured, bespoke financing was launched in Singapore and Indonesia in 2014 and in Malaysia in early 2015"	Natural
The inaugural financing using this product was for a major palm oil exporter which has been a member of the RSPO for ten years and is now fully certified. The product is available to both existing and future clients and is hoped to encourage an expansion in the proportion of palm oil that is certified sustainable	Natural
"China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and Mexico have decided to certify their operations as a result of HSBC’s new policies and deadlines. A number of others were already certified.

"The World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands policy  This is designed to protect unique sites of outstanding international significance as listed by the UN and wetlands of international importance. The policy relates to all business customers involved in major projects, particularly in sectors such as forestry, agriculture, mining, energy, property and infrastructure development. The policy helps HSBC to make balanced and clear decisions on whether or not to finance projects which could have an effect on these sites or wetlands. HSBC has avoided financing projects in light of the policy"	Natural

"Renewable energy procurement In 2014, we signed three power purchase agreements with renewable energy generators in the UK and India. This is expected to provide 9% of HSBC’s energy. In August, a 10-megawatt solar power plant in Hyderabad, India came online to provide the Group with clean energy. This is expected to power three Global Service Centres and a Technology Centre in India. HSBC played a key role in facilitating the project by agreeing to purchase the plant’s energy at a government backed fixed price for the next ten years. The plant will provide a clean and reliable source of energy. In addition, we have redefined our renewables target only to count energy from newly constructed renewable energy sources which have been commissioned by HSBC"	Natural

"To incorporate all of the operations over which we have financial (management) control, the calculated carbon dioxide emissions are scaled up on the basis of the FTE coverage rate to account for any missing data (typically less than 10% of FTEs). In addition, emission uplift rates are applied to allow for uncertainty on the quality and coverage of emission measurement and estimation. The rates are 4% for electricity, 10% for other energy and 6% for business travel, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and our internal analysis of data coverage and quality"	Natural
