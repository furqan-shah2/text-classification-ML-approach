"othing ever stands still at Sage. We have seen another year of improved revenue growth in 2014 and have made significant progress towards our aim of delivering a step-change in both the level and sustainability of growth. We remain on course to deliver the financial targets we have set for 2015, reporting organic revenue growth of 4.9% and organic operating margin of 27.5% for the year. The acceleration of the move to subscription driving strong recurring revenue growth demonstrates the quality of this revenue growth"	Financial
We have appointed Stephen Kelly as Chief Executive Officer. We will now drive the next phase of our strategy. We are building on sound foundations	Human
"Our portfolio – modern, innovative solutions addressing the needs of our customersThe key initiatives underpinning the strategy continue to progress well. We are capturing the benefits of a more global approach: “think globally whilst delivering locally.” Sage One and Sage ERP X3, as global products, demonstrate this change. Sage One is well established as our global cloud solution for smaller businesses, differentiated in the marke"	Intellectual

"We continue to transform the value we offer customers by providing the benefits of online, connected and mobile experiences. Importantly, we do this through powerful technology that is non-disruptive for the customer, which supports their progressive move to the cloud. Our disciplined approach to portfolio management has seen investment prioritised to these key initiatives at the expense of legacy products. Effectively, the portfolio is self-funding the investment in growth."	Intellectual
"Purposeful innovation is a feature across our portfolio. We have built cloud solutions and brought them to market across our three segments. We are investing in mobility, with a focus on applications that bring value to all our customers across a range of user requirements. For example, for micro businesses, we have launched the Sage One mobile app, whilst with Sage ERP X3 version 7, we have a mid-market solution with mobility at its core."	Intellectual
	
Our work on modernising existing products means that on-premise customers can benefit from mobility without compromising their core solution	Intellectual
"We are also investing in remote collaboration, ensuring our customers can work efficiently with their accountants and across their businesses."	Human
"There are many commentators who wonder how well Sage can transition its business model to cope with the cloud. Quietly, and without fanfare, Sage is doing this. By putting customer needs at the heart of all we do, the Company is showing in its rapid roll-out of cloud services, and related features, its responsiveness to change. The Company also has not forgotten its installed base of customers, not all of whom want to travel on this journey at the same pace. In offering customers choice in how they deploy their software, combined with customer support which is second to none, Sage is differentiated in the market. We consider customer satisfaction is a better measure of progress than simple cloud-based contract numbers"	Social_Relationship
"Sage has built a subscription pricing capability that is making a tangible difference in the business, with more to come. Linking subscription to pricing, product and technology initiatives has proven an effective strategy to drive strong growth of Sage’s subscription base. The transition to a subscription-based model creates a more active and more valuable relationship with a customer for life. Subscription is a key driver for Sage, supporting both our customer-centric approach and our strategy for growth"	Intellectual
"A focus on shareholder returns is at the heart of the strategy. The Board believes that high-quality and sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth, combined with a disciplined approach to capital allocation and progressive dividend policy, will drive superior returns for shareholde"	Financial
"In the past year, we have made new investment in payroll software in the United States with the acquisition of PayChoice. This acquisition strengthens Sage’s position in payroll and HR services in the US and accelerates Sage’s move to the cloud in this market. The acquisition is wholly consistent with our strategy of putting customers at the heart of what we do and provides greater service to our core customer base. We will continue, in a disciplined way, to seek such opportunities"	Manufactured
"Early in the year, Guy Berruyer indicated his desire to retire from the Company. In the 21st century, natural retirement like this will become increasingly rare, and it is to his credit that Guy has reached the end of his 17-year career with the Company happily in this manner. He has made a major contribution to the Company and has established platforms and structures that will last long after he has retired. We all wish him well in his retiremen"	Human
"Sage has only had three Chief Executives in its history and I am delighted that Stephen Kelly joins us as the fourth. He has a deep background in software success and in understanding the needs of SMEs. Whilst, of course, he will want to consider for himself Sage’s evolution, he has indicated his support for the key pillars of the Company’s strategy: increasing revenue growth through focusing our business, capturing the technology opportunity, and gaining the benefits of subscription. We welcome him to Sage"	Intellectual
"We were also joined by Inna Kuznetsova, Drummond Hall and Steve Hare on the Board during the past year. They bring valuable and different perspectives to our deliberations. Finally, on Board-related matters, Drummond Hall has succeeded Ruth Markland as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 5 December 2014. Ruth remains as Senior Independent Non-executive Director. I am grateful for all her diligence as Chair of the Remuneration Committee"	Unclassified
"n summaryIt has been a year of further progress – strategically, operationally and financially. There is, however, no complacency, and in such rapidly changing markets we continue to need to focus our energies on shorter decision timelines, rapid deployment and strong customer focus. We can only do this successfully with excellent people and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our employees and partners for their very considerable efforts in the past year.

Where we operateA global footprint built with local expertiseSage has a presence in 23 countries and sells software all over the world. Our established market positions provide us with a strong platform to bring products and services to both new and existing customers	Social_Relationship
"Localised customer experiencesOne of Sage’s strengths is providing highly-localised software and support to customers. We’re able to do this effectively because our teams are based in-country, so they’re close to the business and legislative issues that affect SMEs in these locations.Rather than simply translating software into multiple languages, we build our products so that they fundamentally reflect the interface, functionality and legislative conventions a person would expect to see in their region.Our ability and commitment to do this sets us apart from many other software vendors."	Social_Relationship
"Our global productsWhilst we’re focused on delivering highly-localised products, a key principle of our strategy is to take a more centralised approach to developing global product roadmaps so that we are more efficient, take advantage of our scale, share best practice across our business and utilise our global talent more effectively"	Intellectual

These results are important in demonstrating we are on track to achieve our financial targets for 2015. Reporting organic revenue growth of 5% (2013: 4%) and operating profit margin of 27.5% (2013: 27.1%) means the Group remains confident of achieving the targets of 6% organic revenue growth and organic operating profit margin of 28% in 2015	Financial
"Recurring revenue grew organically by 7% (2013: 6%), whilst organic SSRS revenue contracted by 1% (2013: flat). The increase in recurring revenue growth is a key feature of these results and reflected a strong software subscription performance. Software subscription revenue grew organically by 28%, reflecting acceleration in the second half on the 23% growth reported in the first half. The recurring revenue growth and strong software subscription performance are important indicators of the underlying strength of the business and underpin confidence in the improved growth trajectory expected for 2015"	Financial
"Recurring revenue, which includes software subscriptions, payments and support, now represents 73% of Group revenue (2013: 71%). The continuing shift to a higher quality revenue mix reflects the increased contribution from software subscription. The software subscription contract base continues to grow, with over 450,000 contracts across the Group."	Financial
"The increase in organic revenue growth has been achieved despite a weaker performance in payments, particularly in North America. Improving the performance of payments and driving the number of integrated payments customers remain key priorities, particularly as they have performed below our expectations this year. Likewise, underperformance in the mid-market in France continued as a drag on growth. This was reflected in the lower full-year organic growth rate of 7% (2013: 12%) reported for Sage ERP X3, our global solution for the mid-market. Sage ERP X3 grew well internationally, however, delivering 20% growth outside of France. The ambition for double-digit long-term growth for Sage ERP X3 remains."	Financial
"Software subscription is growing well, in line with our plans for measured adoptionWe are pursuing more active relationships with our customers through subscription. Our progressive approach is based on demonstrating the benefits and flexibility subscription offers them, rather than by mandatorily moving them to subscription pricing"	Financial
The resulting commitment to offering customers choice around how they can buy a software licence reflects the importance we place on customer satisfaction and retention	Social_Relationship
The emphasis is therefore on Sage to present customers with differentiated propositions that persuade them to make the transition to subscription	Intellectual
"he growth in the annualised value of the software subscriber base of 29% to £220m, together with subscription contract renewal rates in the region of 90%, is good evidence that our measured approach is effective"	Financial
"The move to subscription is attractive for Sage and our customers as it builds greater and more predictable revenue streams for the future. By balancing subscription adoption across new and existing customers, we are managing the potential near-term impact on revenue of the transition to subscription. The opportunity we have with existing customers around growing share of wallet, improving retention rates and increasing recurring contract attachment, is helping us to manage the near-term impact of subscription displacing licence revenue"	Financial
"Our cloud solutions, core product modernisation initiatives and growing portfolio of connected services are providing subscription catalysts for all of our customers, regardless of whether their core system is on-premise or in the cloud. Core product modernisation is a particularly significant opportunity with the Sage installed based. It creates the flexible architecture required to liberate customer data and make it available in the cloud so we can deliver an enriched desktop experience enhanced with connected services"	Intellectual
"Core product modernisation has been an important catalyst in driving subscription across our portfolio in 2014. Key highlights during the year include Sage 50 Payroll in the UK, Sage Ciel Flex in France and Sage 100 i7 in France"	Financial
"Sage 50 Payroll auto-enrolment connected serviceThis connected service, which helps SMEs in the UK comply with new pension legislation, has been a strong driver of growth. It is only available on subscription and is supported on the latest version of Sage 50 Payroll. This revenue is incremental because we typically added new services into customers’ existing premium support plan bundles in the pas"	Financial
"At the end of September 2014, the annualised value of our auto-enrolment subscription contract base was approximately £8m. This reflects an attachment rate amongst customers that needed to comply with auto-enrolment in 2014 of over 60%. We are well placed to continue supporting businesses that will need to comply with auto-enrolment legislation going forwar"	Financial
"Sage Ciel FlexSage Ciel accounting and payroll products are aimed at start-up and small business (“SSB”) customers in France. The success of the tiered subscription offer called Flex shows that SSB customers are willing to move to a recurring subscription relationship if they see a product offers added value. At the end of September 2014, the annualised value of our Sage Ciel Flex subscription contract base was approximately £9m, an increase from £5m in the prior year. Over 60% of customers on subscription have chosen to subscribe to Sage Ciel Ultraflex, which is the highest tier available and includes premium features and cloud capabili"	Financial
Sage Ciel Flex demonstrates well the reactivation of off-plan customers. Approximately 50% of revenue from new Flex contracts secured in the financial year were with customers who were previously not on a recurring support plan	Financial
I would like to thank Guy Berruyer for leading Sage to deliver an encouraging set of results with a strong finish to the year. I reconfirm the Board’s financial targets for 2015 and recognise the 2014 results as an important milestone on the path to meeting them. Our financial performance demonstrates the strength of Sage’s global business and the quality of relationships it has with millions of SME customers worldwide	Financial
	
"Sage 100 i7Sage 100 i7 is aimed at small to medium sized customers (“SMB”) in France. It is a premium subscription product and has now been a driver of upgrade activity in the French installed base for several consecutive reporting periods. It offers a major user interface upgrade, can be accessed through a web browser and incorporates business intelligence and spreadsheet integration capabilities. We also launched Sage 100 i7 Payroll during the year, which has driven upgrade activity in the second half"	Intellectual
"he end of September 2014, the annualised value of our Sage 100 i7 ERP and payroll subscription contract base was over £16m. The vast majority of the subscriber base is made up of migrating existing customers who have a support contract, where the strategy is to drive higher average selling price on subscription. This reflects the premium positioning of the product. Sage 100 i7 is either available on a subscription-only contract or a lower-priced subscription contract together with an up-front fee. These fees are helping us to smooth the impact our subscription transition is having on our SSRS revenue base"	Intellectual
"Momentum building in the cloud, with 86,000 Sage One paying subscriptions globally Sage One is well established in the market as our global software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solution for smaller businesses, with a ca.150% increase in paying subscriptions to 86,000 (2013: 35,000). We continue to push ahead with our global roll-out for Sage One, which is available in 10 countries, so that we are well placed to drive growth in markets as cloud adoption accelerates"	Financial
"We continue to make good progress with Sage One in the UKI, where the number of paying subscriptions more than doubled to 47,000 from over 21,000 in the last 12 months. This represents a strong increase in average run-rate to over 2,100 per month, up from around 1,300 per month last year, and reflects acceleration to 2,300 per month in the second half of the yea"	Financial
"We also have strong traction with Sage One in South Africa, where the number of paying subscriptions increased from 8,700 to over 21,000 in the last 12 months. Adoption in Continental Europe remains low, reflecting nascent uptake of cloud solutions amongst SSB customers more generally in that market. In North America, the number of paying subscriptions remains behind plan, but we continue to build a product portfolio to provide an attractive cloud platform for small businesses"	Financial
"As part of the Group’s continued investment in the cloud, our SaaS entry-level products in France, Germany and South Africa were redesigned and incorporated into the Sage One portfolio during the year. This involved rebranding and aligning the user interface and product workflows to create global consistency. Excluding the newly incorporated products, year-end Sage One paying subscriptions were 52,600 (2013: 22,400"	Intellectual
"age’s hybrid cloud solutions for SMB customers are gaining traction, with the number of paying subscriptions doubling during the year to 1,500. The launch of Sage ERP X3 version 7 in the summer means we also offer the mid-market a solution with mobility and web access at its core. We expect to see further good progress in adoption for these solutions in 2015"	Intellectual
62% of total research and development (“R&D”) expenditure (2013: 52%) and 57% of total sales and marketing (“S&M”) expenditure (2013: 52%) is now directed towards the Invest portfolio.

This represents the way software has been sold traditionally in the industry for many years"	Financial
"SSRS revenue is typically more susceptible to economic cycles. When the economy is buoyant, businesses have more confidence and so are more willing to invest in their IT infrastructure"	Financial

"The world of an SME is an exciting but rapidly changing place, with each  day bringing new competitive, economic and regulatory challenges"	Unclassified
Sage has been the advocate of SME businesses for over  30 years and we’ve developed an intimate understanding of their needs over that time. We continue to play an important role in helping them achieve success through the innovative products and value-adding services that we provide	Intellectual
Our global presence and considerable resources mean  our customers trust us to stay the course with them as  they grow and be there for them when they need us most.	Social_Relationship
Addressing our marketsWe address the SME market by dividing it into  three segments: – Start-up and small businesses (“SSB”) – Small to medium sized businesses (“SMB”) – Mid-market businesses	Unclassified
We do this because the characteristics of a small  business differ markedly to those of a larger business. Recognising these differences and tailoring our products  and services accordingly gives us a competitive advantage  in our markets and is one of the reasons why customers choose us	Intellectual
"Customer demand driversWe regularly speak to our customers to understand what matters most to them.  We’ve found there are some key needs that resonate particularly strongly with  SME businesses, which fall into five areas. They want:"	Social_Relationship
"Meeting customer needsOur product and service offering has evolved in direct response to what our customers have told us is important to them. This has influenced our approach to support in particular, which we manage as a value-adding service in its own right, rather than as basic aftercare."	Social_Relationship
"he demand drivers have also defined our strategy, where we are adapting our product and service offering in response to trends in our markets, particularly in relation to cloud technology and subscription.This section considers each demand driver and explores how support, technology and subscription are helping us to more effectively meet the challenges posed by each"	Intellectual
	
"Most entrepreneurs don’t go into business to be a bookkeeper or an accountant, yet maintaining good accounting records is important.As businesses grow the range and variety of issues they face also grows, with increased operational complexity, international expansion, hiring more employees and a greater reporting burden just some examples of new challenges they might face"	Unclassified

"Our support offeringOver the years, we’ve been pioneering in delivering proactive business support to SMEs where our support experts provide technical, accounting and regulatory advice to our customers"	Intellectual
"We deliver much of this support directly either online or over the telephone, where we receive over 30,000 calls a day, and we even offer on-site support when required.Our professional services offering that delivers system installation, maintenance and support services to customers with more complex or bespoke ERP requirements is supported by a global network of around 20,000 business partners"	Intellectual

"his is because whilst start-ups are least likely to have any kind of in-house accounting expertise, they also have the simplest needs. Once they become accustomed to their software and the regulations that affect them, they can often grow comfortable being self-sufficient.However, larger businesses contend with greater complexity and reporting burdens, so a higher proportion of them rely on the support services provided by us and our business partners"	Unclassified
"Premium supportOur premium support offering represents the highest tier of support and is where customers gain access to the most value-adding features, including free selected software updates, priority call answering and online training materials"	Social_Relationship
"For many customers these services are highly valuable because they are often the only available resources they have to help them identify, understand and comply with new legislation that affects them.We are also highly proactive in preparing our customers for new legislation by running awareness campaigns and working with government to not only understand what is changing, but to use our understanding of the SME market to shape those changes"	Social_Relationship
"Always up to date with subscriptionPaying for software on a subscription basis is also an effective way to remain compliant. As a subscription customer is essentially purchasing a service from us, they are entitled to all future software upgrades as soon as they become available.Customers therefore don’t need to worry about whether their software has the necessary features to allow them to comply with new standards or conventions, which means they can concentrate on running their businesses."

"Control to achieve success and growSaaS and mobility offer businesses an unprecedented level of control because they provide access to data anytime, anywhere.However, there are a range of use cases for this technology that vary across the segments we serve"	Intellectual
"Appealing and intuitive softwareThe cloud and technology are redefining the expectations people have of the software they use. Touch-based user interfaces, “big data” analytics, more powerful mobile devices, mobile applications and greater integration between services are just some examples of how technology is helping our industry meet customer need"	Intellectual
"SaaS is a great example of where the cloud is delivering real change for start-up and small businesses. For example, many entrepreneurs have traditionally used spreadsheet software as their first accounting solution largely because they usually already have access to it.Accounting software has also tended to address the needs of the bookkeeper rather than the owner-manager in the past, making accounting seem complicated to those who need to maintain business records but aren’t financial experts"	Unclassified

Engaging user experiencesAdvances in software design and the user experience aren’t confined to new SaaS solutions. The success of touch-based smartphones and tablets has given rise to a change in how users expect to interact with the software they use	Intellectual
"Customers want software to be modern, engaging and visually appealing, which makes it more intuitive and learnable for the average user.We’re responding by modernising the user interface design of some of our most successful products.Examples of where customers are already seeing these improvements include the UK version of Sage 50 and Sage ERP X3 version 7, which employs a completely new, web-first user interface"	Intellectual
"Modern user interfaces are also helping to make business software accessible to a greater range of users.Financial users have been the primary target audience for business software traditionally, but business data has significant utility outside the finance office.For example, field-based salespeople and engineers can be much more efficient if they’re able to access data and manage their work flows in real time."

"We’re using the latest cloud technologies to liberate customer data so that it can be accessed by a range of new mobile applications, including mobile billing, sales and payments. This is helping to broaden the appeal and relevance of business information to more users"	Intellectual
"Mobility use casesIn the case of start-ups and small businesses, it is likely the highly-mobile owner-manager is both the bookkeeper and the decision maker, so being able to record new transactions and view key business information whilst travelling is extremely valuable"	Unclassified
"In the case of a more established business, decision makers find value in having mobile access to business intelligence, but core accounting and invoice processing will almost certainly be managed by office-based finance teams.We believe making these distinctions is important so that we are clear on where and how we will add the most value."	Intellectual
	
"More established businesses need to weigh the benefits of moving data and business infrastructure to the cloud against the operational risks of doing so.Businesses are often concerned about who owns their data and where it is stored when they move it to the cloud because they need to consider the privacy, business interruption and disaster recovery implications.They may also have concerns around exercising less control over when software updates and maintenance are carried out, which can be an issue if they occur during critical reporting periods and something goes wrong"	Unclassified
"Customisation is important to larger businesses, particularly in the mid-market. However, depending on the technology involved, there may be limits to how much a pure cloud solution can be tailored to the specific needs of a particular business"	Intellectual
"On-premise software remains popular because it continues to provide businesses with comfort and flexibility around these issues. However, we don’t want these businesses to have to curtail their cloud vision and we’ve been innovative in addressing this challenge"	Intellectual
Our cloud ERP products offer our SMB and mid-market customers the best of both worlds; they can place their data and business infrastructure in the cloud but continue to have a level of control that is more consistent with an on-premise environment.	Intellectual
"Lower-risk investment decisions through subscriptionInvesting in IT infrastructure is often expensive. High up-front costs make new ventures risky because, if they fail, businesses are left with equipment and software they don’t need"	Intellectual

"The industry is moving away from delivering software as one large application in favour of several smaller applications, with each one offering a discrete piece of functionality.When coupled with subscription, this lets businesses pay for only the software they need, rather than requiring them to buy everything an application can do even if they don’t use all of"	Unclassified

More active relationships through subscriptionA key principle of our business model is that we want to have active and ongoing relationships with our customers. Active relationships are important because they help us to better support our customers and grow the range of services they take from us because we are better able to anticipate their needs	Social_Relationship

"Dual model approachEven though we are focused on transitioning customers to subscription, retaining their business and ensuring they’re satisfied is always of paramount importance.This is why we’re driving a measured transition where perpetual licensing remains available alongside subscription, which preserves our customers’ ability to choose and gives them the flexibility to move when they’re read"	Intellectual
"The financial impact on SageThere have been a number of market communications in recent years from other software vendors where they expect to suffer a short-term dip in revenue as they transition their business to subscription. This is the result of subscription revenue being recognisable over time, whereas perpetual licence revenue is typically recognised up-front"	Intellectual
"We are well-placed to mitigate the likelihood and extent of such a dip. In particular, we are in a position of strength with 73% of revenue already recurring in nature, the majority of which would not be displaced by subscription. The continuing availability of perpetual licensing also creates a portfolio effect so that the impact of any revenue displacement is gradual"	Intellectual
"Subscription growth driversThere are also a number of other important subscription drivers available to us, several of which help us to generate incrementally new revenue.These drivers include attracting new types of customer to Sage who are looking to pay on subscription, reactivating existing customers who are not on another type of recurring contract with us, and increasing subscription adoption amongst existing customers more generally through up-selling and cross-selling a broader range of subscription-based products and services"	Intellectual

"There are millions of businesses who use our software, and many also maintain some form of ongoing contract with us for additional services such as payments or support"	Unclassified
"Subscription offers us the chance to engage with customers who don’t have one of these contracts, which we refer to as “off-plan” customers.These customers require a catalyst to move onto a recurring software subscription contract with us, and our cloud technology initiatives are providing compelling reasons to move.Most importantly, we’re able to drive subscription adoption across the majority of our customer base because we’re committed to bringing cloud-based connected services to all of our customers, even where they choose to keep their core system on-premise."

Activating off-plan customers through subscription is a significant growth opportunity because it is immediately revenue-enhancing and does not displace any existing revenue streams	Financial
"Cross-sellingWe’re able to maintain a much more intimate relationship with a subscription customer, which means we can anticipate and be more attentive to their needs"	Social_Relationship
This can help to increase our effectiveness at cross-selling other relevant products and services because we can be more targeted in our approach.Our connected services strategy is providing us with the platform to drive this cross-sell and increase our share of wallet	Intellectual
Subscription customers pay on an ongoing basis for as long as they require the use of their software and are entitled to receive all future upgrades to their product. The value of a subscription relationship is therefore greater than that of a perpetual licence over its lifetime.This makes subscription a much higher-value revenue stream over the long term that gives us greater visibility and certainty over our future revenue potential	Financial
"Lifetime value growth is the primary opportunity we have with our existing on-plan customers, particularly as they are already active and are paying to take additional services from us. Technology-driven added-value features and intelligently priced product and service bundles are providing these customers with reasons to swap their support contract for a software subscription relationship"	Social_Relationship
"RetainGreater customer loyaltyPerpetual licence customers typically buy software in multi-year cycles. In the intervening years we may not have frequent contact with these customers, unless they also have a support relationship with us, so making them aware of upgrades or other relevant products and services is more difficult.Subscription changes the dynamics of the relationship because there is no multi-year buying cycle, customers are entitled to all upgrades as soon as they are available, and we’re able to work much more closely with them to ensure they’re satisfied. This reduces the likelihood a customer might be tempted to switch because their needs are being me"	Social_Relationship
Software subscription has very high rates of renewal as a result – we see renewal rates of around 90% by volume. This compares to renewal rates on support contracts of around 80%. Retaining our customers is incredibly important because we want them to be satisfied so that we preserve the long-term revenue potential contained within our installed base	Social_Relationship

"Whilst Sage Ciel Flex has been successful in driving growth in new customer acquisition and existing customer migrations, it is also a great example of off-plan customer reactivation.

We aim to reduce the energy our business uses and make the most of recycling opportunities. We comply with local laws as a minimum standard and Sage continues to take part in the global Carbon Disclosure Project.	Natural
Organisation boundary and responsibilityWe report our emissions data using an operational control approach to define our organisational boundary which meets the definitional requirements of the Regulations in respect of those emissions for which we are responsib	Natural
"We have reported on all material emission sources for which we deem ourselves to be responsible. These sources align with our operational control and financial control boundaries.  We do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are beyond the boundary of our operational control. For example, business travel other than by car (including, for example, commercial flights) is not within our operational control and, therefore, is not considered to be our responsibility."	Natural
"The methodology used to calculate our emissions is based on the “Environmental Reporting Guidelines: including mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance” (June 2013) issued by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”). We have also utilised DEFRA’s 2014 conversion factors within our reporting methodology. In some cases, we have extrapolated total emissions by utilising available information from part of a reporting period and extending it to apply to the full reporting year. For example, this has occurred where supplier invoices for the full reporting year were not available prior to the publication of this year’s Annual Report & Accounts. For further details, our methodology document can be found at www.sage.com/about-sage/corporate-social-responsibility."
