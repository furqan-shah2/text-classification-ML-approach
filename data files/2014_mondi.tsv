"I am pleased to report another successful year for Mondi. Underlying earnings per share increased by 13% to 107.3 euro cents per share, and our ROCE was 17.2%. The Group’s solid financial results, delivered despite continued slow economic growth in a number of key markets, are testament to our robust business model and high-quality, low-cost asset base."	Financial
"Revenue was broadly in line with the prior year. On a like-for-like basis, selling prices and volumes were similar to the prior year with revenue boosted by the acquisition of the bags business in the US, offset by negative currency impacts and disposals or closures of non-core businesses."	Financial
	
"Underlying operating profit of €767 million was up 10% on 2013. Packaging Paper continued to deliver very strongly despite a generally weaker pricing environment, driven by cost reduction and currency benefits"	Financial
"Our Fibre Packaging business benefited from lower paper input costs and good volume growth. Consumer Packaging saw a strong improvement in trading in the second half of the year. Coupled with the benefits of a number of sales and margin improvement initiatives, the business was able to deliver a pleasing improvement in year-on-year performance. Uncoated Fine Paper came under pressure from weaker pricing and negative currency effects, but nevertheless continued to deliver strongly, while the South Africa Division benefited from higher average selling prices and the weak rand."	Financial
"Contributing to these results were the benefits from recently completed capital investments, primarily around energy efficiencies and other cost optimisation in the pulp and paper operations, and continued strong cost management across the Group. In addition to lower energy costs, our energy investments completed over the last few years have significantly improved the efficiency and self-sufficiency of our larger, more energy intensive pulp and paper operations"	Natural
	
"Consistent with the prior year, the impact of the Group’s maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit was around €55 million. In 2015, the effect is expected to be more significant, with longer shuts planned at certain mills to allow for project implementation and the move of certain mills to an 18 month rotation. The impact on underlying operating profit, at prevailing price levels, is estimated at around €80 million."	Financial
"Cash generated from operations of €1,033 million was similar to 2013, despite an increase in working capital of €87 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 12.3%, marginally above our targeted 10-12% range"	Financial
"Growing in line with our strategyWe remain well positioned as a leading international packaging and paper group, with a strong platform for growth. Our clear intention is to grow our packaging interests.We will continue to develop our presence in emerging markets, particularly in our pulp and paper operations, where inherent growth and cost benefits are most apparent.

"Economic growth is expected to remain well below historical averages in the regions in which we operate. We expect this slow economic growth to continue to impact on demand for our products in the short term, although underlying industry fundamentals remain generally sound, with supply/demand balance supported by supply-side constraint."

"The world we live in is changing – fast. Accelerating globalisation, shifts in demographics, dynamic macroeconomic environment, improved technology, climate change and biodiversity loss are just some of the trends that are increasingly affecting the way we do business"	Unclassified
"Despite global efforts, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to rise and climate change is the most significant global challenge we face. It remains top of the global environmental policy agenda, influencing regulations and market dynamics. We fully consider climate change in our business decisions, strategies for growth and public commitments"	Natural
WWF’s Living Planet Index indicates severe degradation of ecosystems over the last decades. Biodiversity and habitat loss can have adverse impacts on the ecosystem services that businesses and communities rely upon. We manage our land and associated ecosystems in a sustainable way and procure wood exclusively from responsible sources	Natural
"Changing global social trends (such as population growth, urbanisation and rising incomes) and the associated rise in material consumption is causing increased pressure on constrained natural resources. We are responsibly managing the natural resources we rely on, such as fibre, fresh water and fuel, and offer products that promote resource efficiency"	Natural
"Ongoing deforestation and land conversion continue to cause biodiversity loss and are major contributors to climate change. Forest certification not only addresses deforestation, but also promotes sustainable forest management. However, about 90% of global forests remain uncertified and unless urgent change is made to improve and simplify certification processes it is unlikely that the situation will improve. We are actively involved in promoting change."	Natural
"We are operating in an increasingly transparent and globalised world, with people connected through information and communication technology and the rising use of social media. This trend impacts on our markets, strategy, communication and engagement approach, stakeholder expectations and our reputation. We actively engage with a wide range of stakeholders, and seek to increase transparency by publicly disclosing our performance on a regular basis."	Social_Relationship
	
"Economic growth is a clear driver of demand for Mondi’s products. From a global perspective, the recovery from the 2008/2009 financial crisis continued in 2014, albeit at a slower and more uneven pace than was anticipated. In particular, growth in emerging markets was at a slower pace than historical averages. In the short term, conditions are expected to remain challenging, with growth below the long-term average in most regions where we operate."	Unclassified
"Economic development in emerging markets is supporting the rise of a sizeable middle class. As more people enter this demographic, new hubs for consumer demand appear, creating growth opportunities for many of our products"	Unclassified
"Global populations are becoming increasingly urbanised, often resulting in smaller and busier households. Improved living standards are also helping to increase life expectancy"	Unclassified
"These demographic trends influence packaging demand as consumers require more convenient and innovative solutions such as enhanced shelf-life and storage, flexible portion sizes, and easy-to-open features"	Intellectual
"Packaging is often the most important way for brands to communicate with consumers, particularly in-store. For products with fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) applications, there is increased demand for packaging to enhance the visual appearance of products through advanced options for printing, design functionality and materials usage. Packaging can also provide protection from counterfeiting and theft, particularly in premium segments."	Intellectual
"Consumers are increasingly aware of environmental issues, supporting the growth of products that use sustainable materials and are produced in an environmentally responsible way. Brand owners and end users require packaging products that minimise cost and waste, without impacting product functionality. A key element of this trend is light-weighting, essentially doing more with less. Plastic-based packaging has a role to play in supporting the sustainability agenda. It provides benefits ranging from enhancing food security by extending shelf-life and reducing food waste, to offering solutions that incorporate recycled materials"	Natural
"Digital technology continues to revolutionise the way people do business, buy things, work and live. Improved connectivity provides more opportunities for trade and online shopping, extending the reach of global commerce and supporting growth in our key packaging grades that help to protect, transport and sell goods. In office environments, digital platforms such as cloud storage and email are changing the way in which paper is used. While substitution effects prevail, opportunities have emerged such as digital print solutions that allow businesses to offer customised mailings and related services"	Intellectual

"The Uncoated Fine Paper business generated underlying operating profit of €148 million, down on the prior year as a result of lower average selling prices in Europe and the impact of a significantly weaker Russian rouble. Good cost control, benefits from the restructuring of the Neusiedler mill in Austria, completed in 2013, and lower input costs provided some offset to these headwinds."	Financial
"Demand for uncoated fine paper increased by around 1% in Europe, while Russian demand is estimated to have declined by approximately 3% compared to the previous year."	Unclassified
