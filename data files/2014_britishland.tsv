"our properties attract over 300 million visits each year and are places where almost 100,000 people work or live. through our five-year development programme, we are supporting  a further 32,300 jobs, fuelling growth and engaging with local communities. We work  with our supply chain to create apprenticeships, giving people the chance to learn while they earn at our assets, at the same time as developing the workforce of tomorrow for our sector. our community programme also stands out for the high level of staff involvement, with over three quarters of our people volunteering this year"	Social_Relationship
"in addition, we work closely with our supply chain to manage carbon emissions and other environmental impacts at our properties and developments. i continue to be pleased with the substantial reductions we have achieved in landlord-influenced energy costs for occupiers. this reflects the way we run our business, with our customer orientation and environmental emphasis"	Natural
"i am delighted to have taken the lead for corporate responsibility at British land, an area that  i have always been interested in. it is in keeping with our mindset that the person responsible  for finance is also responsible for social, environmental and ethical issues. our commitment to these issues helps us to create places people prefer, and so to deliver long-term value"	Unclassified
"We identify the social, environmental and ethical issues that matter most by working  with people across the business, engaging  with external stakeholders, consulting experts, reviewing best practice, benchmarking our performance, monitoring the external context and carrying out risk assessments. this year, 750 stakeholders completed an online survey exploring social and environmental issues related to our business, over 100 experts appraised our approach to carbon and energy management, and many participated in independently facilitated workshops on  key social and environmental issues"	Natural
"Different stakeholders have markedly different priorities and we need to strike a balance. so, alongside our other stakeholder engagement activities, our corporate responsibility Panel, chaired by chris grigg, includes external experts who provide market insights on changing trends in their fields and challenge our approach. through our corporate responsibility committee, we then develop and implement  our strategy and monitor performance"	Natural
"our long-term social and environmental targets will conclude in March 2015. We have made good progress on these during the year, as detailed in our full Data report 2014.  During the coming year, we will continue to focus on delivering these targets and will also implement our supply chain plan to address  key social and environmental issues, notably increasing our focus on human rights. We are working with the Prince’s accounting for sustainability Project to put sustainability at the heart of business decision making, strategy and reporting. areas that have proved challenging this year that we will continue to focus on, both directly and through our supply chain, include local procurement and employment, renewable energy in existing buildings and embodied carbon on developments"	Natural
