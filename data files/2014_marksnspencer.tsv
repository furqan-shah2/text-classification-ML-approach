"The retail industry is going through a period of profound change. Many of the actions we set out as part of our strategy three years ago, and have since implemented, put M&S in a stronger position to compete in this new world"	Unclassified
"In 2013/14, we delivered major infrastructure projects that strengthened our business. Our new M&S.com website and our new distribution centre at Castle Donington are both essential in our strategy to transform M&S from a traditional British retailer into an international, multi-channel retailer."	Manufactured
We have repositioned our website as our ﬂ agship and its design has been centred on the needs of our customers. Castle Donington is one of the largest dedicated e-commerce sites in the UK and is capable of processing over one million products a day. We are now working to ensure these projects deliver at their full operating capability	Intellectual
"We made these improvements against a challenging economic backdrop. Consumer confi dence improved over our fi nancial year but overall increases in incomes lagged inﬂ ation, meaning that consumers did not feel the benefi t in their discretionary spending."	Unclassified
"Our performance over the year was mixed and, as a result, our underlying profi ts before tax fell 3.9% to £623m.Our three-year programme of exceptionally high capital expenditure associated with our strategic priorities is now completed. We are working hard to prepare our business for the future, while not forgetting the values that underscored our past. Now we are focused on delivering the fi nancial results from this investment."	Financial
"We made progress in three areas this year: Food, M&S.com and International. Our online business performed ahead of the market and the new website, launched in February, was recognised as industry-leading; our food business is growing faster than the market and operational effi ciencies were achieved; and we saw growth in our International business, with a strengthened presence and signifi cant growth in our priority markets."	Intellectual
"However, our General Merchandise performance did not meet our own expectations. The team is working hard on a comprehensive plan to address this. Improvements in product quality and style were welcomed by our customers and, together with operational effi ciencies, now have to be delivered consistently to translate into the required improvements in fi nancial performance."

"DividendOur dividend policy remains a progressive one, with dividends broadly twice covered by earnings. In line with this policy, we remain committed to delivering consistent returns to our shareholders. We intend to pay a fi nal dividend of 10.8p this year, taking the total dividend to 17p, unchanged from last year."	Unclassified
"The Board’s prioritiesIn my fi rst report as Chairman in 2011, I wrote that the Board focuses its work on three main areas: strategy and execution, people and succession, and values. This remains the case. Our strategy to transform M&S from a traditional British retailer to an"	Unclassified

"Our priority now is to deliver on the investment we have made and to make M&S more profi table, as well as a stronger, well-equipped business. There is real potential for further profi table growth, both in the UK and overseas. We have highlighted the opportunities for growth and performance improvements in each area of our business in this report and at our recent investor days: this applies in both our Food and General Merchandise businesses, whether in store or online, in the UK or internationally"	Financial
"Finally, we are fortunate to have exceptionally talented and dedicated employees. I never cease to be impressed by their commitment to M&S and their pride in what they do. One of the great highlights of my year is meeting the many who have given 25 and 40 years service. There are some quite remarkable stories amongst them and they exemplify the spirit alive in the company.

Vindi Banga will replace Steve as Chair on his departure"	Unclassified
"Our heritage, values and Plan AM&S has been trading for 130 years. Our success over that time stems in large part from our commitment to clear core values, including quality and trust. Just as enduring values have defi ned our past, so they are crucial to our future. In recent years public mistrust has spread through many areas of business and this stems from the absence of clear values. This is not the case at M&S, where an emphasis on integrity is at the heart of the way we do business. We expect to be held accountable by our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders in this respect."	Social_Relationship
"Nothing demonstrates our commitment to our values more than Plan A, our programme to become the world’s most sustainable major retailer. We have deliberately set the bar high for ourselves. We strive for excellence in this fi eld and are candid when we don’t measure up. ‘Doing the right thing’ makes economic as well as ethical and moral sense: a sustainable business is also a profi table business. We have just launched a new set of commitments that will refocus Plan A to ensure M&S is set up to respond to the new models of sustainable change. The commitments will also ensure that Plan A’s values are clearly communicated to customers"	Social_Relationship

"OverviewIt is crucial that we listen to our customers to understand what they expect from us and how the economy is affecting their shopping behaviour. Our Customer Insight Unit (CIU) listens to and analyses responses from 18,000 customers a week and combines market research with customer feedback to monitor the national mood"	Social_Relationship
"Market overviewThe UK economy is improving. Gross Domestic Product is predicted to grow by 2.7% in 2014, while house prices have increased by 8.5% in a year. Inﬂ ation is falling and employment is rising. Just 14 months ago, consumers were concerned about a triple-dip recession. Now, a genuine recovery feels like a more realistic possibility."	Unclassified
"As a result, there has been a steady increase in consumer confi dence over the last year and people have started to feel that the worst is over. But the increase in confi dence is not yet translating into a complete turnaround in consumer behaviour. Spending remains measured. Despite glimpses of happier times ahead, people remain level-headed. Indeed, although confi dence is higher than it has been for years, it is still in negative territory. There are two main reasons why."	Social_Relationship
"First, people realise that we are not out of the woods yet. Consumer debt is still high, the government’s austerity programme could run for another six years and wage growth has only just caught up with inﬂ ation. People recognise that the current low interest rates will not last for eve"	Social_Relationship
"Second, the downturn has made consumers warier and more alert than they were. They are telling themselves that they won’t be led into trouble again. They blame the banking crisis on reckless extravagance and the notion of consequence has taken root in the national psyche. As a result, shoppers are being more considered and consumers are being more cautious with their money."	Unclassified
"How this has affected M&SSubdued spending continued to affect the retail sector this year, and saw deep levels of promotion, particularly in the lead-up to Christmas. M&S responded to this promotional landscape by offering more promotions than in previous years. However, the emphasis on treats played to our strengths. Whether they were after a new pink coat, a special meal or cushions to refresh the home, customers were constantly recognising the quality of M&S products"	Intellectual
"When it came to clothing, people were spending more money on our ‘better’ and ‘best’ ranges. This fi tted in with our strategy of emphasising the quality, style and heritage of our clothes. The customer and fashion press feedback on our new ranges was extremely positive"	Social_Relationship
"Customers are also willing to spend a little more on special events. We responded with newness and innovation, and more special occasion foods than ever before."	Intellectual
"The internet has changed the way consumers shop. An increasing number of customers are using online as a source of inspiration and research before they purchase in stores or online.

We responded with our new website, which focuses on delivering a better browsing experience, as well as an improved buying process, as explained on page 26"	Unclassified
"Our priority markets of India, China, the Middle East and Russia have all seen GDP growth. The rise of the middle class in these markets has fi rmly established shopping malls as the key vehicle for international trade, with the landscape dominated by large shopping mall operators who have specialist insight and expertise of the markets in which they operate. This has driven our international strategy of working with partners to open ﬂ agship stores in prime malls and key shopping locations. Another emerging trend is the growth of the lingerie market in the Middle East and India, which is expected to grow by 30% and 54% respectively by 2017. We responded with our fi rst standalone Lingerie & Beauty store"	Unclassified
"The Eurozone is also on the turn. The growth opportunity in our other priority market, Western Europe, lies in the rapidly expanding online clothing market. We responded with a bricks and clicks strategy, which focuses on ﬂ agship stores that deliver brand presence supported by a strong online offer. Our food is as unique internationally as it is in the UK, and the growing demand in Western Europe for convenience food shops opens up new opportunities for Food store growth."	Unclassified
	
"ClothingThe overall clothing market grew in value terms but slowed in volume terms as shoppers were more measured in their spending. Whilst confi dence levels were up on last year, this did not translate to strong sales on the high street, although signs of improvement in the clothing market started to come through."	Financial
"We listened to our customers and focused the relaunch of our Womenswear on style, quality and design. We upgraded 70% of our fabrics, added more luxurious fi nishes and improved our ‘better and best’ offer with more leather, silk and cashmere.
