"Notably, our production performance in all our key businesses has been ahead of plan. During October 2014, we were able to ship our first ore from Minas-Rio earlier  than expected and within the revised capital budget of  $8.8 billion. This is testimony to the unrelenting endeavours of the team in Brazil. However, the dramatic drop in the iron  ore pricing environment, which has been particularly acute  in the near term and has also dragged down long term  price expectations, has resulted in a $3.5 billion non-cash (post-tax) write down in the asset value of Minas-Rio."

"otwithstanding the tough pricing environment, there have been several encouraging developments. Our platinum operations in South Africa are recovering strongly from the prolonged strike in the first half of 2014, and we are making headway in restructuring the business, including the divestment of operations we no longer consider to be  ‘core’. The operational turnaround at our two major copper interests in Chile, Los Bronces and Collahuasi, is well under way despite the challenges, at Los Bronces, posed by declining grades and ore hardness. At Sishen, our flagship iron ore asset in South Africa, we are on track to restore production to a 38 million tonnes per annum level in 2016.  In Australia, where deteriorating prices for metallurgical coal are putting great pressure on our coal operations, we have managed to dramatically improve productivity, bringing down unit costs substantially at our key longwall operations"	Unclassified
"SAFETYI never fail to be impressed by the level of commitment shown throughout our Group – from Board level to the working face – in safety matters. That is why it is always sad and disappointing to report on loss of life in our business.  In 2014, despite a steep reduction in fatal incidents (after taking the platinum strike into account), and ongoing declining trends in injuries, six people lost their lives – it is incumbent on us all to do whatever it takes to get this figure down to zero"	Human
"Under Tony O’Neill, our technical director, this is being given renewed direction, particularly with the emphasis being placed via our Operating Model on planned work, which is improving performance not only in safety, but in practically all areas of the business"	Human
"Allied to this, we are focusing on the deployment of  new technologies, and particularly those concerning mechanisation and automation, in order to make mining less physically arduous and to eliminate, as far as possible, the potentially hazardous interface between employees and machinery and the rock face. This has led to tightening policy around transportation (along with falls of ground,  the main cause of injuries in our Group), including stricter regulation around transport hire and the advance monitoring of road conditions."

"These macro-economic conditions and the over-supply  of certain mined commodities drove severe price decreases. Such developments are posing considerable challenges  for the global mining industry. This is particularly the case  in bulk commodities such as iron ore, where industry over-expansion created price levels that are more depressed than they might have been. Given these developments, Anglo American is taking further action to cushion the impact of downward price pressures"	Unclassified

"THE ECONOMYGROWTH STABILISATIONGlobal real gross domestic product (GDP) increased  by 3¼% in 2014, the same as in 2013, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). There was a notable divergence in performance, however, between the world’s major economies. Early in the year, extremely cold weather depressed activity in the United States (US), though the economy recovered through the spring and summer. After  a recovery in the spring, the Chinese economy slowed in  the second half of the year. In Japan, activity was robust at the start of 2014, but then slumped following an increase in the consumption sales tax. Europe’s growth remained weak in 2014, especially in the eurozone’s largest economies. Activity remained fragile in emerging economies"	Unclassified
"At the start of 2014, there was growing optimism about prospects for the US economy, but the extreme winter weather contributed to a contraction in real GDP in  the first quarter. The strong recovery in the spring and  summer led to annualised GDP growth of more than 4½%. Improvements in the labour and housing markets and a steep fall in oil prices later in the year supported significant gains in consumer confidence. Business sentiment also improved, encouraging increases in capital spending. After  a significant tightening in 2012–2013, the fiscal squeeze moderated in 2014, imparting a smaller drag on growth.  The Federal Reserve gradually wound down its quantitative easing programme, completing it in October"	Unclassified
"n the first six months of 2014, China’s economy grew in  line with the government’s 7½% target, which was a little below the rate in the second half of 2013. The People’s  Bank of China injected liquidity into distressed sectors  of the economy and the government accelerated some infrastructure projects. In the second half of 2014, growth dropped below the government’s target, mainly reflecting the negative impact of a weakening property market and slower industrial activity. In response, the Bank cut interest rates and allowed the renminbi to drift lower, and the government eased house purchase restrictions and loosened mortgage terms."	Unclassified

Following two years of output contraction, the eurozone registered modest growth as the heavily indebted economies stabilised, with Germany being the strongest of the larger economies. But after robust gains early in 2014, the German economy weakened appreciably later in the year, reflecting the slowdown in its main export markets and the impact  of a stronger euro, especially against the Japanese yen.

With regard to platinum, while demand was higher in aggregate for autocatalysts, industrial and jewellery applications, it was more than offset by weaker investment demand. On the supply side, the five-month South African strike had a major impact and reduced global platinum supply by 700,000 ounces. The positive price response  on account of the apparent deficit was more muted  than expected, partly owing to the existence of above ground stocks."	Unclassified

The strengthening of the US dollar against the South African rand and the Australian dollar resulted in a $1.3 billion favourable exchange variance in underlying EBIT compared with 2013.

Although the mine’s operating costs are already among the lowest in the industry, over the past two years the focus has been  on implementing a number of business improvement initiatives to raise productivity and reduce costs further –  maximising the value delivered from the asset, with minimal additional capital commitment"	Intellectual
"The main initiatives include increasing the effectiveness  of the mine’s drills, explosives, diesel, shovels and mining trucks. These are yielding significant improvements in availability and utilisation. For example, since 2012, drill penetration has improved by 36%, while mining truck utilisation – which has increased by 15% over the same period – is now considered to be world class"	Intellectual
"n 2014, Mogalakwena delivered more than 350,000 ounces of platinum, an increase of 50,000 ounces over 2012.

"Anglo American believes that there will be a transition  over the long term towards a low carbon future that will encompass a progressively more diverse energy mix.  Coal has played a vital role in supporting poverty alleviation and sustaining prosperity. Independent forecasters  foresee a significant continuing role for coal in the energy mix, up to 2040, including under policy scenarios that successfully limit global warming to two degrees Celsius. We believe that the roadmap to reduced CO2 emissions from coal fired power generation involves two steps: firstly more efficient combustion and secondly, in the longer  term, the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. Replacing the world’s inefficient coal plants (those with efficiencies of less than 27%) with existing ultra-supercritical combustion technology, with efficiencies of more than 45%, could cut carbon emissions from coal fired power generation by 40%. In addition to coal, our portfolio also includes metals that are likely to see a major increase in demand as low carbon energy generation expands, most notably platinum and copper"	Natural

"FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW Copper recorded an underlying EBIT of $1,193 million,  31% lower, largely due to an 8% decline in the average realised copper price and a 2% decrease in sales volumes. Operating costs have increased owing to inflation, higher treatment and refining charges, and an increase in mine development at Los Bronces, partially offset by the  benefits of a weaker Chilean peso. At the end of 2014, 164,700 tonnes of copper were provisionally priced at 287 c/lb. Provisional pricing plus final liquidation of copper sales resulted in a negative EBIT adjustment of $196 million for 2014, versus a negative EBIT adjustment of $92 million  in 2013"	Financial
"MARKETS  2014 2013Average market prices (c/lb) 311 332Average realised prices (c/lb)  300 326The average LME copper cash settlement price decreased by 6% in the year to 311 c/lb (2013: 332 c/lb). The copper price fell sharply in March due to fears of large scale destocking in China. Despite a rebound in the price following the Qingdao warehousing scandal in June, the recovery  was tempered by a mild Chinese summer, leading to slower growth in the production of air conditioners, while usage  of copper and copper alloys in Europe exhibited seasonal weakness. On the supply side, strong output from many  of the largest producing mines and the ramp up of new production more than offset constraints in exports  from Indonesia"	Unclassified
"OPERATING PERFORMANCE Production at Los Bronces was 404,500 tonnes, 3% lower than in 2013. Strong throughput performance was achieved as a result of higher mine extraction rates improving the continuity of ore supply and debottlenecking of the plants. This was offset by expected lower grades. Material mined increased by 13% and reached record levels of 145 Mt, with waste stripping increasing by 14% to 62 Mt. Anglo American’s share of Collahuasi’s production of 207,000 tonnes was 6% higher than the prior year. This  was a reflection of continued high grades resulting from improved fleet and primary crusher performance allowing accelerated extraction from the Rosario pit, as well as throughput recovering from the 49-day shutdown of  the SAG Mill 3 in 2013. Material mined also reached  record levels at Collahuasi, increasing by 9% to 251 Mt (100% basis).Production at El Soldado decreased by 37% following expected lower grades arising from the intersection  with a geological fault encountered in 2013. Output at Mantos Blancos and Mantoverde decreased by 4% and  9% respectively, owing to expected lower grades. OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK Production guidance for 2015 is in the range of 720,000 to 750,000 tonnes as lower throughput rates at Los Bronces, resulting from constrained water supply during the first half of the year, are only partially offset by higher ore grades. Production is expected to be maintained at similar levels  to 2014 at the other operations."	Unclassified

"Production at Rustenburg and Union was also reduced following the planned restructuring and optimisation of these mines during 2013, and the closure of the last of the decline sections at Union mine during the fourth quarter  of 2014, all of which accounted for a further reduction of 114,000 ounces.These losses were partially compensated by strong performances from Mogalakwena mine and increases at some of Platinum’s independently managed operations. Production from these operations rose by 2%, led by a  15% increase at Bokoni, 5% at BRPM and 4% at Kroondal.The record production at Mogalakwena mine was due  to higher head grades and increased concentrator throughput, supported by improved mining performance. On-mine production increased by 9% to 348,000 ounces, while toll concentrating activities at a third party concentrator yielded 22,000 ounces.Refined platinum production was 21% lower at 1.89 million ounces (2013: 2.38 million ounces) owing to production shortfalls at the strike affected operations. However, this was partially offset by a drawdown of pipeline metal inventory. The pipeline was steadily increased to normal operating levels by year end, once the mines had ramped up to full production. Refined palladium output decreased by 11%, while refined production of rhodium decreased by 22%, reflecting the industrial action, a different ore source mix from operations, and different pipeline processing times  for each metal. Refined nickel production increased by  25% to 28,200 tonnes, which was boosted by an additional 2,000 tonnes from toll refining, resulting in an overall increase in base metal production to 47,600 tonnes, an increase of 10,000 tonnes.Sales volumes exceeded production volumes owing to the drawdown of built up metal inventory, but were 9% lower than 2013"	Unclassified
"OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK As a result of the successful post-strike ramp up of operations during the third quarter of 2014, Platinum is expected to return to baseline production (equivalent refined and refined production) and sales of between  2.3 and 2.4 million platinum ounces in 2015, with  reduced output from the decline closures at Union mine  in the fourth quarter of 2014 being offset by improved output through the implementation of operational improvement plans"	Intellectual
"FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW Underlying EBIT decreased by $432 million to $32 million (2013: $464 million) as a consequence of the five-month industrial action in South Africa, which had a material impact on production. Sales volumes were also impacted, though to a lesser extent, as sales commitments were met through the drawdown of both pipeline and refined product inventory. Year-on-year cash operating costs per equivalent refined platinum ounce increased by 20% to $2,112 per ounce, owing primarily to lower production from strike impacted mines that continued to incur fixed overhead costs during the period of industrial unrest and increased input costs, including the wage settlement which added approximately 9% to the cost of employment, and electricity costs. The impact of the strike was partially mitigated by applying the ‘no work, no pay’ principle and implementing strict cost controls. The weaker rand also had a favourable impact  on unit costs. In addition to the higher operating costs, the drawdown  of metal inventory during the year to fulfil sales commitments also impacted cost of sales adversely"	Financial

Palladium and rhodium market prices increased by 11% and 10% to $803 per ounce and  $1,173 per ounce respectively, and the dollar basket price increased by 3% to $2,428 per ounce.OPERATING PERFORMANCE Total equivalent refined platinum production decreased  by 21% to 1.84 million ounces (2013: 2.32 million ounces). The decline in production was primarily owing to the  impact of the strike, which commenced on 23 January and ended on 24 June, and affected all of Platinum’s managed underground mines. This resulted in a steep fall in output from Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union mines and a loss of 424,000 ounces of platinum. The build up to steady state production in the third quarter resulted in a further loss of 108,000 ounces, bringing the total strike related impact to 532,000 ounces."	Financial
