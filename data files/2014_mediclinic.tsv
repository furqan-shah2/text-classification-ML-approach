Formal clinical hospital committees were established at all hospitals with well-defined charters and mandates to take the lead for specific patient safety initiatives at hospital level	Social_Relationship

INTERNATIONAL GROUPWe are committed to increasingly using our combined international capacity and resources to unlock value for our Group. During the year we formally concluded the Group’s organisation structure realignment programme.	Manufactured
The operating platforms are at different levels of implementing the platform-specific changes applicable to them. A key building block for the realignment was the decision to implement a standardised Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) solution for the Group	Intellectual
"The implementation will be done in multiple phases and over a number of years, with the key objectives to standardise data elements, simplify solutions, reduce cost and share resources in the Group. Both Mediclinic Southern Africa and Mediclinic Middle East have successfully replaced legacy financial and procurement systems with SAP as the ERP solution, while Hirslanden embarked on a phased approach to standardise the existing stand-alone SAP solutions deployed at the hospitals"	Intellectual
"Various formal cross-platform (Southern Africa, Switzerland and Middle East) work groups, for all the key support functions, are well placed to transfer knowledge, promote collaboration"	Intellectual
	
"share resources and standardise processes. We also successfully established an international procurement office to leverage our scale to unlock value. Encouraging savings have already been realised on the procurement of major capital items as well as specific low-cost, high-volume items"	Intellectual
The Group also benefited from the transfer of clinical skills between our Middle Eastern and Swiss operations where surgeons from Dubai underwent training at Hirslanden hospitals in highly specialised clinical procedures	Human

General insured patients represented the bulk of the increase due to the listing status of our hospitals in Switzerland, with a slight increase in the private and semi-private numbers.

"To address the differences, we embarked on a process to gradually move towards an effectively coordinated healthcare system with the aim to ensure consistently good clinical outcomes and the optimum utilisation of resources. A key component for a better coordinated system is the sharing of clinical information between the different key role players in the clinical care process across our platform"	Intellectual
Hirslanden evaluated and enhanced a clinical information system at one of its hospitals and is about to start with the gradual roll-out of the system to their other facilities	Intellectual
At Mediclinic Middle East all clinical facilities (two hospitals and all clinics) use a standardised and integrated clinical information system giving all caregivers access to current and historical clinical data. Mediclinic Southern Africa currently has access to limited electronic data only and will soon identify and evaluate the best-suited system to its unique requirements	Intellectual
"Medical specialists, irrespective of the clinical model, represent the core of the Group’s clinical delivery capacity. We realise the importance to identify, attract and retain leading specialists at our facilities."	Human

"INTRODUCTIONThe Group delivered strong financial results and growth for 2014, despite continuing challenging global economic conditions. GROUP OVERVIEWGROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe Group uses normalised revenue, normalised operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“normalised EBITDA”), normalised headline earnings and normalised basic headline earnings per share as non-IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) measures in evaluating performance and as a method to provide shareholders with clear and consistent reporting. These non-IFRS measures are defined as reportable EBITDA, headline earnings and basic headline earnings per share in terms of accounting standards, excluding one-off items."	Financial

RESULTS OVERVIEWGroup normalised revenue increased by 24% to R30 495m (2013: R24 587m) for the period under review. Normalised EBITDA is 23% higher at R6 467m (2013: R5 237m)	Financial
"The leveraging effect of the Group’s capital structure, together with the positive effects of the Group refinancing and acquisition of the minority interests in Mediclinic Middle East completed in October 2012, augmented the Group’s financial performance and resulted in basic normalised headline earnings per share growth of 45% to 377.1 cents (2013: 259.3 cents)"	Financial
The current Group results included a number of one-off items which were excluded in determining normalised headline earnings. The one-off items are:•   a past-service cost credit of R241m (R192m after tax) arising in the main Hirslanden pension fund; and •   Swiss prior year tax and deferred tax adjustments amounting to R111m	Unclassified

"ncluding these one-off items, headline earnings increased by 402% to R3 355m (2013: loss of R1 110m) and basic headline earnings per ordinary share increased by 377% to 414.6 cents (2013: loss of 149.5 cents)"	Financial

Examples include the mortality rates, re-admissions and adverse events indicators reported by all three operating platforms, and the extended stay indicator reported by Mediclinic Southern Africa."

Adult critical care mortality – Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II SAPS II is a hospital mortality prediction methodology for patients in the adult critical care setting and is a useful tool in evaluating quality of care in this complex environment. Patients are evaluated and scored on a number of clinical parameters within the first 24 hours of admission to critical/coronary care.

This increase is mostly due to a correction in the identification of cases eligible for counting as re-admissions. In the past these cases were collected manually at each hospital. The process is now supported by a data-driven analysis in the department of medical controlling, which helps the hospitals to identify the re-admissions more accurately.
