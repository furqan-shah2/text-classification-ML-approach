In 2014 Unilever launched a newly developed packaging technology for Dove Body Wash bottles that uses 15% less plastic. Projected cost savings for the whole portfolio are €50 million. This is another substantial step towards the USLP target of halving Unilever’s waste footprint by 2020	Intellectual
"The MuCell® Technology for Extrusion Blow Moulding was created in partnership with two packaging suppliers – ALPLA and MuCell Extrusion.  By using gas-injection to create gas bubbles in the middle layer of the bottle wall, it reduces the density  of the bottle and the amount of plastic required"	Intellectual
"The technology represents a breakthrough for Unilever and the industry. With up to 59 million  Dove Body Wash bottles sold across Europe, the  new technology will save approximately 180 tonnes of plastic a year overall. A full roll-out across every Unilever product and packaging format could save up to 27,000 tonnes of plastic per year. Unilever has waived exclusivity rights from  1 January 2015, so that other manufacturers  can also use the technology"	Intellectual

"Our entire business would rely on increasingly rare and expensive raw materials, pushing up our costs. Without more efficient use of energy our production costs would increase while we would  miss considerable savings from more sustainable packaging and less waste.We would also risk the disapproval of governments, regulators and NGOs,  and our brands – Unilever’s crown jewels – could suffer reputational damage, representing serious economic loss  to the business.That’s why sustainability is at the heart  of everything we do to ensure we have a viable long-term business that is attractive to investors."

OVERVIEWTough economic and financial headwinds with continued competitive intensity made 2014 one of the most challenging years that the industry and Unilever have faced for some time. A slowdown in the growth of emerging markets proved a testing environment while consumers in developed markets continued to show caution. Volatile currencies were a further negative	Unclassified
"However, Unilever’s business model  and strategy proved robust, delivering a competitive performance with underlying sales growth ahead of the market and solid margin expansion. Our growth model is based on a leaner, more agile Unilever and consistency of delivery in this more volatile market is key. The Boards remain convinced that a clear, purpose-driven business model is the best way for Unilever to continue generating sustainable, long-term returns for all stakeholders, including our shareholders, as proved by a year of strong, dependable cash flow and steadily increasing"	Financial
"DEEP UNDERSTANDING  OF THE BUSINESSInvesting in people and in innovation is crucial in this tough environment. To that end, the Boards were pleased to spend time at Unilever’s new state-of-the-art training facility in Singapore, and to see first-hand the high-quality innovations being developed for the Refreshment category at Unilever’s global R&D laboratory in Colworth, UK"	Intellectual
The volatile currency environment made our review of the Group’s treasury operations particularly pertinent. The Boards also spent time assessing the quality of talent management and Unilever’s competitive environment. Broad exposure to senior managers in 2014 allowed the Directors to gain a deeper understanding of the business and helped in the wider strategy discussion	Unclassified
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT 2014 WAS ANOTHER YEAR  OF PROGRESS FOR UNILEVER ACROSS A NUMBER OF FRONTS DESPITE A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT FOR THE BUSINESS.	Unclassified
"STRATEGIC DISCUSSIONSThe Boards held in-depth discussions with management on strategy and portfolio development with particular attention to changing market dynamics especially in emerging markets. Despite the short-term challenges, the Boards believe the growth story in these markets remains intact.  The challenges in developed markets  are no less important; one response to which is our new Baking, Cooking and Spreading Business Unit in Europe and North America"	Unclassified
The Boards also reviewed the progress made under the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). The Directors are confident that the USLP remains hugely relevant in addressing today’s global challenges and will continue to be a long-term driver of profitable growth for Unilever	Social_Relationship
"BOARD COMPOSITION  AND SUCCESSIONWe continue to work on succession planning for both the Boards and management, and thorough processes are in place"	Unclassified
"Our Directors bring complementary and relevant skills to the Boards. In addition to wide global experience, these skills include expertise on finance and accounting, consumer markets, science and technology, customers and marketing as well as government and legal experience. I’m delighted that Feike Sijbesma has joined the Boards with effect from  1 November 2014. Feike, who has a wealth  of experience as a sustainable business leader and in finance, food and nutrition, has already added considerably to the Boards’ discussions."	Human
DIVERSITYOver 40% of our Non-Executive Directors are now women. This is not surprising for a Group that has long understood the importance of diversity within the workforce and wider value chain.

The Boards continue to function well with good leadership and competent and engaged members. Good progress has been made on the actions agreed in previous evaluations. The actions agreed by the Boards in the 2014 evaluation included the continued focus on overall strategy, portfolio management, and succession  and induction planning"	Unclassified

"HOW WOULD YOU SUMMARISE 2014 FOR UNILEVER?A: In a volatile environment consistency  of results is key. Our model calls for consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible growth. With 2.9% underlying sales growth, and good profit progress,  this is the fifth consecutive year of top and bottom line growth. This was achieved despite a challenging external environment"	Financial
"Our business is growing ahead of our markets with 60% gaining share and we believe this growth is also competitive. The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) helps to ensure growth is responsible. The consistency of our delivery is underlined by the fact that our average growth over the last five years is 4.9%, making us one of the most reliable performers in our industry."	Social_Relationship
"Q: HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERISE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH YOU HAVE HAD TO OPERATE OVER THE LAST YEAR?A: Very challenging and among the most difficult I can remember. We certainly faced more headwinds than tailwinds.  For the first time in many years, for example, we had to confront the reality  of largely flat developed markets and markedly slowing emerging markets. Indeed, markets slowed from some  3.5% in 2013 to around 2.5% in 2014."	Unclassified
"At the same time, the world continued to  be rocked by a combination of geopolitical instability and natural, climate-related disasters that have sadly become the norm"	Natural
"All of these add a cost to doing business, which is why we believe that confronting these issues and looking for solutions to them – rather than just being buffeted by events – is the only long-term viable growth model. Agility is equally important in this environment and we have worked hard once again to reduce complexity and evolve the organisational model for speed and efficiency"	Natural
"UNILEVER CONTINUED TO GROW AHEAD OF ITS MARKETS IN 2014 AND RE-AFFIRMED ITS REPUTATION FOR CONSISTENT TOP AND BOTTOM LINE GROWTH, ENSURING CONTINUED RETURNS FOR INVESTORS. PAUL POLMAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ANSWERS THE KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT 2014"	Unclassified
"WHAT PLEASED YOU MOST ABOUT THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE IN 2014?A: The ability to deliver results while balancing the needs of our multiple stakeholders. The consistency of our delivery, even in these unusually volatile and uncertain conditions, helps. It reassures me that the fundamental pillars of the business are strong and that we have developed the resilience needed to compete even in the most difficult circumstances."	Social_Relationship
"What pleased me specifically was that we were able to take the short-term measures necessary to respond to events – further tightening our belts, for example, and simplifying the organisation through initiatives like Project Half for Growth – while at the same time continuing to invest in the long-term drivers of growth. The launches of some of our biggest brands into new markets – like Omo in the Gulf, Clear  in Japan or Lifebuoy in China – were great examples of this."	Unclassified
"We also made a number of strategic acquisitions over the year to help strengthen our portfolio further: the Talenti super-premium ice cream business in North America, for example, and the Qinyuan water purification business in China, both take us into some attractive segments of the marke"	Manufactured
"I was equally delighted by the progress  we made during 2014 in increasing our proportion of female managers. There is much still to do, but beating our stretching targets and ending the year with women representing 43.3% of all managers was a great achievement and a real sign of the commitment felt across Unilever to make progress in this area."	Social_Relationship
"Finally we have made further progress on sustainable sourcing, decoupling growth from environmental impact and increasing positive social impact throughout our value chain. This  has further enhanced our corporate reputation and lowered risk and costs"	Social_Relationship
"WHAT DID ALL THIS MEAN  FOR THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE?A: Weakening consumer demand certainly impacted our underlying sales growth yet  it provided a great opportunity to accelerate our efficiency effort. Growth was therefore profitable, with an improvement in core operating margin of 0.4 percentage points, driven by strong savings programmes. Tight control of working capital contributed to another year of healthy cash flow delivery (more than €3.1 billion) which – combined with the improvement in operating margin – contributed to earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2% (or 11% adjusted for  currency impact)."	Financial
"We continued to reshape our portfolio  in 2014 to ensure resources are best utilised for growth. In June we sold the Ragu and Bertolli pasta sauces business in North America for approximately  US $2.15 billion. We invested capital  in growth opportunities by acquiring  a majority stake in the Qinyuan Group,  a leading Chinese water purification business. This doubled our size in this sector, addressing a fast-growing consumer need and furthering our aim  to grow our business sustainably. More details of our mergers and acquisitions activity can be found on page 29"	Manufactured
	
"Our employees remain a  key priority of course and, despite the constrained economic environment, we  did not compromise on our investments  in training, personal development, safety and other employee support programmes. It was heartening to see employee engagement scores remain at historically high levels in our annual Global People Survey (GPS), with improvements across  all five metrics"	Human
"t is also clear that the demand to join Unilever has never been greater. We received over 2 million applications  or expressions of interest in 2014 and  for the second year running Unilever  was ranked the third most in-demand employer among jobseekers on LinkedIn, behind only Apple and Google, as more  and more young people want to work for purpose-driven organisations"	Human
"ARE THERE AREAS IN WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN MORE PROGRESS?A: Even though we have made significant strides over recent years in improving our organisational agility and our ability to respond quickly to events, there is still room for improvement. I would like to have seen us react a little quicker, for example, to the slowdown in a number of markets, particularly China, where frankly we were caught off-guard by the speed and scale  of weakening consumer demand. In terms of our categories, all of them contributed – albeit in different ways – to the overall performance of the Group and I have confidence in the strength and long-term growth potential of our portfolio"	Intellectual
"We took steps last year to sharpen the portfolio even further with a number of strategic acquisitions and disposal of non-core brands, although there is always scope to do more and I would like to see the level of activity accelerate in the year ahead. It is also clear that we still need to do more to get our Foods category growing again, although we are winning market shar"	Manufactured
This is a tough business to be in – with much of our portfolio in flat or even declining developed markets – but we have to do more to leverage the strength of our wonderful Foods brands and bring back the growth momentum	Unclassified
"By contrast, while our Home Care and Refreshment categories delivered good or solid growth, we need to increase the levels of cash and profitability if we are to invest in the many growth opportunities. These will all be priorities  in 2015"	Financial
"HOW DID UNILEVER SERVE  THE INTERESTS OF ITS VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN 2014?A: Meeting the diverse interests of multiple stakeholders is a challenge for a company of Unilever’s size but also a great opportunity given our Vision to grow in  a sustainable and socially inclusive way. Once again, we made good progress"	Social_Relationship
"We also made progress in our commitment to serve a wider group of stakeholders through the USLP and our Vision of  growing the business while reducing our environmental footprint and increasing  our positive social impact, not only in that part of the business under our direct control but throughout the whole value chain"	Social_Relationship

WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE PRINCIPAL CHALLENGES FOR UNILEVER IN THE YEAR AHEAD?A: Operating in an environment of almost unprecedented volatility and complexity will remain a big challenge for everyone. Few people predicted that in 2014 we would see such a sharp slowdown in some of the major world economies or the escalation of geopolitical conflicts  or the outbreak of pandemics like Ebola and oil prices ending the year at less than US $50 a barrel. We must be prepared for a similarly unpredictable year in 2015	Unclassified
"The key is to have a model that responds  to people’s needs and concerns, and an organisation that is both resilient and agile in the face of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. We achieved that again in 2014 and I want to thank – and recognise – the supreme efforts of our 172,000 colleagues and the many more partners around the world"	Social_Relationship
"WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK  FOR 2015?A: We expect the economic pressures  to continue. Consumer demand in emerging markets is likely to remain subdued for some time to come. There  is still little sign of a recovery in Europe and, while conditions in North America have improved, any increase in consumer demand is likely to be slow and shoppers will remain focused on value"	Unclassified
"We are also prepared for managing  any continuing volatility on the world’s currency markets and for what could be fluctuations in commodity costs as a result of the reduction in oil prices. At  the same time, we expect the levels of competitive activity – both from global competitors and, increasingly, from  local players – to remain high in 2015"	Unclassified
"Despite these pressures, we are confident that with the many positive changes we have already made to Unilever we are  well placed to continue delivering our objectives of volume growth ahead of  our markets, steady and sustainable improvements in core operating margin, and strong cash flow"	Financial

CONSUMERSINSIGHTS FOR INNOVATIONA fundamental requirement at Unilever is to understand our consumers. We use focus groups  and quantitative studies and spend time with consumers in stores and in their homes to find out  what is important to them – as citizens as well as consumers – so we can create products they need  and want. Unilever carelines are also a rich source  of information. Digital communications and social media mean we can engage with large numbers of people consistently over long periods of time so we can immerse ourselves in their day-to-day lives. We can use online search data to identify and anticipate future consumer trends and gain a competitive edge	Intellectual
