Performance We are pleased to havedelivered another year of good performance in what remains a difficult economicenvironment for customersin the North West of England. Underpinning all we do is our vision of becoming a leading North West service provider and one of the best UK water and wastewatercompanies and we havemade progress against thisobjective on a broad front.

"High levels of customer satisfaction remain our core objective. We have again delivered a year of improvement as measured by our regulator, Ofwat’s, Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM). This places us as one of the most improved companies for customer satisfaction over the last three years."	Social_Relationship
"Whilst comparison with other water and sewerage companies is an important benchmark for us, werecognise that customer expectations are often set by standards of service delivered by other companies operating in the North West. So we conduct a brand tracker surveyand we are happy to find ourselves consistently ranked third out of ten leading companies, just behind the respected brands of John Lewis  and Marks & Spencer."

"Even so, we don’t always get it right, and customer satisfaction will remain an area of focus for us – reducing service failure benefits both customers and shareholders."	Social_Relationship
"Targeted investment in our people, assets and processes is delivering results and we are ahead of schedule in delivering our regulatory outperformance targets."	Unclassified

Much of our capital programme of over £3.5 billion for the period 2010–15 supports renewal and upgrade of our asset base to maintain serviceability but a significant proportion also delivers our capability to meet new environmental standards	Manufactured
"Wedelivered our largest annual capital programme for a decade, investing £836 million – £49 million more than the previous year – in areas that included contributions to river and bathing water quality and inspecting the Haweswater aqueduct for the first time since it was built in the mid 1900s"	Manufactured
"We measure the effectiveness of our investment using our Time, Cost and Quality index, TCQi, and we scored 98 per cent for the year – ahead of our targets and a significant improvement on our performance of three years ago"	Social_Relationship
"Our good performance in this five-year regulatory period, AMP5, has created the ability for us to re-invest. We are investing around £200 million of capital savings into projects which improve service to customers or benefit the environment"	Social_Relationship
Around £40 million of our financing outperformance is supporting our private sewer network and we have committed a £75 million cash tax refund from HMRC to assist customers struggling to return to regular payment. We believe that this reﬂects a responsible approach to sharing the benefits of outperformance between customers and shareholders.	Social_Relationship
"The North West remains a region with the highest proportion of disadvantaged households in England and reducing customer indebtedness continues to be a major challenge for us. Our collection teams have worked hard in another difficult year to hold bad debt levels at 2.2 per cent of revenue, with over 30,000 customers taking advantage of our many assistance schemes. Containing bad debt at this level will remain a challenge as benefit reforms continue to roll out across our region."	Social_Relationship

Instead, we are committing to partnering with others who can support the achievement of the required outcomes. This includes our ‘Turning Tides’ partnership with the Environment Agency, Local Authorities, the Marine Conservation Society and others to improve bathing waters in the North West."

"Our updated Water Resources Management Plan describes the expected pattern of water resource availability in our region until 2040. The majority of the North West is in surplus, benefitting from an integrated network that supports movement of water across the region to accommodate its changing supply and demand balance"	Natural

This includes incidence based targeting on areas more likely to experience ﬂooding and more use of CCTV sewer surveys to identify issues. For 2015–20 we are targeting a further reduction in the risk of sewer ﬂooding inside customers’ properties, seeking opportunities to work in partnership with others to deliver cost-effective joint schemes and promoting the use of more sustainable drainage systems. Our wastewater network will continue to benefit from significant investment going forward as we adapt to weather patterns likely to result from climate change."	Social_Relationship
"We are developing a new business operating model for our wholesale business area, embracing innovation in control technology and work processes."	Intellectual
"Delivery of this business model is critical to our future ability to offset the growth in bills arising from new environmental regulation whilst continuing to deliver our target return for shareholders.  Our progress over the current regulatory period, combined with our plans for further improvements in the next five years, will mean average household bills will have grown by less than inﬂation in the decade to 2020."

We have continued to support these North West communities both financially and in terms of employee time through volunteering.
