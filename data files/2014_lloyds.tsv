"UK ECONOMIC TRENDSEconomic recovery has picked up in 2014Seven years after the start of the financial crisis, the UK economy is returning to a level of stability. Initial estimates indicate that economic growth rose to 2.6 per cent in 2014 from 1.7 per cent in 2013, the strongest rate of growth since 2006 and above the economy’s long-term average growth rate. Unemployment has fallen rapidly – by twice as much in 2014 as across the previous two years combined – and at 5.7 per cent has now reversed the bulk of its rise during the recession. Consumer spending growth and the level of private car registrations have returned to pre-crisis rates. Rising business confidence in response to the upturn in demand has been reflected in a significant increase in business investment, now higher as a share of GDP than before the crisis. The rate of corporate failure has fallen back after its rise in 2009, and is now the lowest on record (since 1984) at 0.5 per cent."	Unclassified
"At the root of the economic recovery is the progress that has been made on reducing the high levels of debt that were a key driver of pre-crisis growth. Household debt has fallen back to decade-ago levels relative to incomes, and with interest rates low the burden of debt payments is its lowest since the late 1990s. That has decreased the pace of consumer deleveraging, helping spending growth to recover. The government is broadly half way through its deficit reduction programme, and the pace of fiscal consolidation has also eased markedly, thus reducing its drag on growth. Most of the banking sector, including Lloyds, is on target to meet the new higher capital and liquidity levels mandated by CRD IV and the PRA, so lending supply is able to respond to rising demand."	Unclassified
"But as the deleveraging process is not yet complete, some aspects of the economy continue to look abnormal. Most obviously, the Bank of England’s Bank Rate (base rate) has remained at 0.5 per cent since 2009. The fiscal deficit remains large at over 5 per cent of GDP, and so requires a continued squeeze on public spending throughout the next Parliament after the May 2015 election. In addition, export growth remains subdued by weak"	Unclassified
"demand in the Eurozone, the result of much less progress on private sector deleveraging and the rapid pace of fiscal tightening. The increasingly robust UK economic recovery has benefited our markets, although balance growth remains substantially lower than pre-crisis rates, as shown in the chart below"	Unclassified
"Robust growth expected to continue in 2015With inflation low and deleveraging progressing at a manageable rate, UK economic growth is expected to continue at a similar rate in 2015 – the current consensus is 2.6 per cent, still above the economy’s long-term average growth rate of around 2.2 per cent (see chart below). Domestic demand will remain the driver, with households’ real income growth expected to benefit from higher earnings growth, falling unemployment and lower inflation, helped especially by the large fall in oil prices since the middle of 2014. We expect Bank Rate to begin to rise around the end of the year, for the first time in eight years, but the pace of increase is likely to be slow as responsiveness of the economy to interest rates normalises only gradually"	Unclassified
"As the economic recovery continues, we expect demand for credit from households and small and medium-sized businesses to rise, but growth is likely to stay well below pre-crisis rates as the appetite to borrow remains constrained by recent experience. With Bank Rate expected to rise only slowly, arrears are expected to remain low."	Unclassified
"Risks to the recovery remainAs the recovery continues, and adjustments in debt levels have progressed, the vulnerability of the economy to renewed weakening has reduced. Similarly, the outcome of the Scottish Referendum has removed a key source of near-term uncertainty for the economy and banks. However, with the General Election in May, political uncertainty remains high. The Eurozone remains a risk to the UK, not only because of its potential impact on UK growth, but also because of the financial market turbulence that would ensue if weak growth translates into election of political parties that favour Eurozone exit for some countries. Crystallisation of some of these risks could impact the UK economy significantly, which would in turn have a negative impact on the Group’s income, funding costs and impairment charges. Positively, the recent fall in oil prices, if sustained, will be a boost for global growth and could be particularly beneficial for Eurozone growth"	Unclassified

"New European Union legislation on capital ratios came into force in the UK on 1 January 2014. The Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) aims to ensure that firms hold enough financial resources to cover the risk associated with their business. The Basel Committee also continued to review its capital framework, including the consistency of Internal Ratings Based (IRB) models, standardised credit calculations and the capital requirements for operational risk. Other recent related capital regulation includes the UK leverage ratio framework announced by the Bank of England in October 2014. The Group has significantly strengthened its capital position in recent years and is now comfortably in excess of minimum requirements on both its CET1 ratio and its leverage ratio. The resilience of our capital position was demonstrated in 2014 when we exceeded the threshold for both the PRA and EBA stress tests. We will continue to be subject to these annual tests going forward."	Financial
"Ring-fencing and resolution regulation, through both the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 and the European Commission’s Recovery and Resolution Directive, continues to be a focus. Banks will be required to ring-fence retail and SME activities from their investment banking activities to ensure consumers are protected. As a UK focused retail and commercial bank, most of our operations are expected to be within the ring-fence and therefore the impact is likely to be less than for many of our peers."	Unclassified

This year our overall carbon emissions have decreased by 2.2 per cent year-on-year and by 20.9 per cent against our 2009 baseline. The majority of this reduction is attributable to the reduction in consumption of gas and electricity, which constitute the largest proportion of our emissions. This reduction is mainly due to energy management activity, for example continued optimisation of building management systems to ensure that heating and ventilation plant and lighting run times are matched to actual building occupancy times, and investment in 2014 of around £3.8 million in specific energy efficiency measures, such as boiler controls, new lighting and building management upgrades"	Natural

Reported Scope 2 emissions cover emissions generated from the use of electricity.
