HOW WE MEASURE PERFORMANCE:  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS	Unclassified
We use the following  nine key performance indicators (KPIs) to  measure our financial and  non-financial performance	Unclassified

"DefinitionSales growth after deducting excise duties, excluding the impact of exchange rate movements, acquisitions and disposals.Why we measureThis measure reflects our performance as the result of the choices made in terms of category and market participation, and Diageo’s ability  to build brand equity, increase prices and  grow market share.PerformanceOrganic net sales were up 0.4%, reflecting a mixed performance with growth in North America, stability in Western Europe and weakness in emerging market economies."	Financial
"DefinitionThe percentage point movement in operating profit before exceptional items, divided by net sales after excluding the impact of exchange  rate movements and acquisitions and disposals"	Financial
"Why we measureDiageo is focused on delivering efficient growth. The movement in operating margin measures the efficiency of the business. Consistent operating margin improvement is a business imperative, driven by investment choices, our focus on driving out costs across the business and improving mix."	Financial
"This year the biggest drivers of margin improvement have been overhead savings and marketing procurement savings, delivering our commitment to 200 basis points of operating margin expansion in three yea"	Financial

For reward purposes this measure is further adjusted for the impact of exchange rates and other factors not controlled by management, to ensure focus on our  underlying performance drivers."

"PerformanceLower operating profit, principally reflecting the strength of sterling and increased restructuring costs, was the biggest driver of lower free cash flow year on yea"	Financial
DefinitionProfit before finance charges and exceptional items divided by average invested capital.	Financial
Why we measureReturn on average invested capital (ROIC) is used by management to assess the return obtained from the group’s asset base. Improving ROIC builds financial strength to enable Diageo to attain its financial objectives	Financial
"PerformanceLower operating profit, primarily due to adverse exchange movements, the investment in United Spirits Limited and increased working capital led to the reduction in ROIC"	Financial

"Diageo used 6.9 litres of water to produce one litre of packaged product, a 2.4% decrease from 2013. While some savings are the result of major investments, most come from operational improvements related to equipment,  processes, culture and behaviours"	Natural

"Moreover, reporting on these issues is becoming mandatory in more parts of the world. For example, the UK Companies Act, the US California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the US Dodd Frank Act, require public disclosure of human rights and environmental issues. This year, the European Council and the European Commission reached an agreement to require publicly-traded companies with more than 500 employees to report performance against a number of social and environmental metrics"	Unclassified
This high and growing level of regulation and scrutiny can be an advantage to companies with good corporate governance and the right approach to sustainability and responsibility.	Unclassified
"Alcohol policyWhile the approaches taken by governments to address alcohol misuse vary, Diageo believes that the most effective alcohol policies are evidence-based, account for drinking patterns, target at-risk groups, treat all forms of alcohol equally, and involve all stakeholders"	Unclassified
These include mandating a minimum legal purchasing age of not less than 18; a maximum blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level for drivers of no more than 0.08mg; and lower BACs for novice and commercial drivers. Also effective are high-visibility enforcement campaigns of drink-driving laws and alcohol interlocks1 for convicted drink drivers.	Unclassified

Organic volume growth in reserve brands was largely offset by decline in beer and in scotch in emerging markets. The strong performance of reserve brands and selective price increases drove positive price/mix	Financial
The organic increase in operating margin was primarily driven by an increased focus on costs and efficiencies across the business and by procurement savings on marketing spend	Financial
Reduction in eps due to lower operating profit was largely as a result of adverse foreign exchange movements. Increased income from associates and joint ventures and lower net finance charges partly mitigated the impact of reduced operating profit	Financial
