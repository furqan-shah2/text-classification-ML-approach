"under a managed model, the owner of a hotel uses a third-party manager to operate the hotel on its behalf and pays the manager management fees and, if the hotel is operated under a  third-party brand name, brand licensing fees; and•  a franchised hotel is owned and operated by an owner under a third-party brand name, and the owner pays a brand licensing fee to the brand owner"	Manufactured
"Other models, such as pay-for-performance or commission-based, are sometimes used by independent hotels to benefit from a brand’s booking distribution system (for example,  hotel collections)."	Unclassified
"Whilst an owner-operated hotel enables the owner to have full control over the hotel operation, it requires high capital investment. In contrast, for hotel brand owners, a managed or franchised model enables quicker rooms growth due to the lower capital investment, but this requires strong relationships with third-party hotel owners. As a franchisor and manager, we therefore recognise that our owner proposition is a key part of our strategy"	Social_Relationship

Across the globe, the types  of traveller can range from single people to multi-generation families.

The size of the IHG System, and our concentration on priority markets and key gateway cities, allows us to benefit from economies of scale, which lead to higher margins and operating leverage. With  scale, we can invest in our brands and  the technology required to support their continued growth, and deliver efficient sales and marketing and procurement practices, thereby increasing the advantages an IHG brand brings to  owners. Scale also enables us to invest  in, and grow, new brands and take them global, for example Hotel Indigo."	Intellectual

Combined with a strong loyalty programme, it also increases awareness and recognition of the IHG brand, and of each of the individual hotel brands, helping us to drive business. Guests who have an increased loyalty to IHG and its portfolio have also proven to have a higher spend per stay. Both of these result in higher RevPAR premiums, thereby increasing total gross revenue and strengthening our owner proposition."	Social_Relationship

IHG has therefore established a set of policies, procedures and measures, and complies with relevant legislation. We ensure the protection and well-being of those working for IHG through suitable work-based strategies, minimise the risk of injury from work activity, ensure that sufficient information is provided and systems are in place to address health and safety concerns, and involve employees in the continuous improvement, reporting and review of health and safety matters"	Human
"Why we think it is importantWe believe that by ensuring our business is committed to responsible business practices we will enhance and protect the reputation of IHG and our brands. It provides us with the opportunity to protect the environment, create job opportunities, improve community resilience and make us more innovative. Doing the right thing in the right way enables us to make an even greater contribution to the locations where we operate. It also ensures we  act in a manner that benefits all of our stakeholders, including employees, guests, corporate customers, owners and the local community, who are increasingly considering whether the businesses with which they interact share their values.  This provides us with a competitive edge, assisting us to deliver profitable growth  and create shared value for all stakeholders in the long term"	Social_Relationship
