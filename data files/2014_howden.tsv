"2014 was a notable year for Howdens, and one in which we made significant progress on a number of fronts. A milestone was reached with sales of over £1 billion. Gross margin continued to improve and strong cash generation resulted in the further strengthening of our balance sheet"	Social_Relationship
"We  have identified more opportunities to take Howdens’ business further forward, and  we are well placed so to do. Over the course  of the year we took important steps to  develop the organisation, and its talent,  that will allow us to make the most of these significant opportunities."	Unclassified
STRATEGIC PROGRESSDuring 2014 we increased our focus on improving the performance of our depots and of our supply operations through mobilising our managers and their teams and engaging them in our shared objective – to build a business that we can all be proud of that will continue to deliver value to all concerned for many years to come	Social_Relationship
Howdens is now operating on a very large scale in a world that grows more complex every day. Managing this combination of scale and complexity successfully is our primary task	Unclassified
We have developed a strategic plan for Howdens to 2020 and beyond. This plan envisages the further development of our UK operations through continuing improvements in the performance of existing depots and significant further expansion of our depot network to take advantage of new opportunities beyond those originally envisaged.	Unclassified
"It follows that it is a priority to make sure that nothing interrupts the continuing availability of stock to our depots. We are therefore stepping up our investment in manufacturing, distribution and infrastructure as the business grows. In particular, we plan to invest in new warehousing facilities and in the resilience of our operations to support future growth"	Manufactured
For some years we have also been exploring the prospects for Howdens beyond the UK. We have effected a step change in the profitability of our French depots and we believe the time is right to build on the nucleus of our French business. We are also drawing on our experience to test our way forward in Belgium and Holland	Manufactured
"ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTIn May, following a review of our structure and capabilities, we announced a number of organisational changes designed to support the continuing growth and development of Howdens"	Unclassified
"Mark Robson was appointed Deputy Chief Executive, and is now responsible for the day-to-day management of the business. Matthew Ingle continues in his role as Chief Executive, focusing on the further development and implementation of our strategy, and in particular on the culture and the values of the business that have served Howdens so well and will underpin our future success"	Unclassified
"This powerful combination of Matthew and Mark is supported by Rob Fenwick, who spearheaded the restructuring of Howdens' supply operations from 2005 and leads the supply division, and Andy Witts, a co-founder of the business and leader of the depot management team"	Unclassified
"Together, our senior executives are leading the work of organisational and talent development and recruitment that is essential to the long-term sustainability of the business"	Human
"SHAREHOLDER RETURNSOur stated intention is an earnings per share based dividend cover of between 2.5 and 3.0 times, with one-third of the previous year’s dividend being paid as an interim dividend for the following year"	Unclassified
"Given the operational performance of the business and the level of cash generation in 2014, the Board is proposing a final dividend"	Unclassified
	
"in respect of the year of 6.5p per share, giving a total dividend of 8.4p per share for 2014 (2013: 5.5p)."	Unclassified
"We have said that we are targeting a capital structure that is both prudent and recognises the inherent leverage in the business and, after considering our capital requirements, will return surplus capital to shareholders as appropriate. The Group has significant property leases for the depot network, and continues to have a material defecit in the Group pension fund and a small number of legacy liabilities related to the Group’s former ownership of MFI. Taking into account this underlying level of gearing, the Board continues to believe that it is appropriate for the Group to be able to operate throughout the working capital cycle without incurring bank debt."	Unclassified
"Against this background, the Board has reviewed the Group’s cash balances in light of our future investment opportunities, anticipated peak working capital requirements and the trading outlook. As a result it has decided to return £70m of cash to shareholders by way of a share repurchase programme. This will commence shortly and will be implemented over the course of the  next two years"	Unclassified
"BOARD COMPOSITIONThe Board functions as a small but effective team and I am indebted to my fellow directors for their hard work and commitment to the Group. In particular I would like to thank Michael Wemms, our Senior Independent Director, for his work as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, a role which has now been taken on by Tiffany Hall. Michael and I have both served on the Board for eight years and the Board is therefore giving consideration to the appointment of our successors. In my case, the transition to my replacement will be overseen by Michael. The Board is also considering the merits of appointing a further non-executive director."	Unclassified
A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSI firmly believe that Howdens’ commitment to growth and development must be matched by a continued focus on being a responsible company. Our business model emphasises the	Social_Relationship
"importance of our values, of fair dealing and of personal, local accountability. We work to make sure these values are reflected in the way we treat individuals, in our interactions with the wider community and in the work we do to reduce our environmental impact. In all of these areas, we aim to implement standards that will deliver lasting benefits. A detailed report on our corporate responsibilities can be found on pages 22  to 27."	Social_Relationship
"2014 was an extremely busy year for Howdens and one which placed considerable demands on our people and, in turn, on their families. I am sure that you would wish me to place on record our great appreciation of their considerable efforts and achievements"	Social_Relationship
"LOOKING AHEADHowdens has undergone a major transition in the last five years. Since 2009, profits have more than doubled, as have earnings per share, and the balance sheet has been transformed. Legacy pressures have been overcome, our strategic flexibility has considerably increased and we see good prospects for the further development of the business"	Social_Relationship
"Looking ahead, we expect that the strong cash generation that is a feature of Howdens’ business model will enable us both to pay attractive dividends to shareholders and to make the substantial capital investments necessary to make the most of the many opportunities we have identified within and beyond the UK."	Social_Relationship
"The environment in which we operate is constantly changing. We remain confident in the resilience and flexibility of the Howdens model, and it goes without saying that we will continue to adapt rapidly to suit economic and market conditions and to manage the business in the fashion that has served us so well over the years."	Unclassified
	
"The idea of the business is about building worthwhile, personal relationships so that we can deliver value to all concerned – which means small builders, kitchen users, employees (including past and future employees and their families), business partners, shareholders, local communities and in fact everyone whose life is touched  by Howdens"	Social_Relationship
"To make the business work properly, we have to do things in an uncompromising way. We have to build relationships of trust with our suppliers, both of raw materials and of finished products, so that we can offer the right design, quality and price in every category"	Social_Relationship
We also have to recruit and retain highly motivated staff who consistently do what they say and are prepared to take personal responsibility for their actions.	Human
"We have to design, manufacture and source products expertly and at lowest cost, and distribute them in such a way that our depots are always in stock locally and never let the builder down"	Intellectual
"We have to have low central overheads, because builders only want to pay for things they need"	Unclassified
"Finally, we have to earn the confidence and trust of builders, who rely on us to support their reputation with products of the right type and quality that their customers are proud to own"	Social_Relationship
"We supply these products to builders  when they want them, i.e. from stock,  on confidential trade terms"	Unclassified
"So Howdens is a direct, person-to-person business. This is its core strength and its difference. This is the source of its ability to deliver value in more ways to more people.The business functions because individuals rely on each other to deal promptly, effectively and fairly with everyone, whether they are in  a factory, depot, warehouse, design studio  or office"	Social_Relationship
"This sounds straightforward, but it is hard work. Everything is finely balanced, because everyone depends on everyone else. Personal relationships are individual, dynamic and unpredictable. Businesses find talking about them, and managing them, uncomfortable, but Howdens is built on them"	Social_Relationship
"Howdens’ competitive advantage is rooted in our ability to manage the complexity that is involved in doing what it takes to sustain these relationships and to offer direct, practical help, every day, to hundreds of thousands of customers and thousands of different homes around the country"	Social_Relationship
"This is the basis on which Howdens was founded in 1995, and these are the principles which have driven its growth and survival and created opportunities for further expansion. They have been resilient enough to help it withstand restructuring, recession and the collapse of MFI, and strong enough to underpin a business that employs over 7,000 people, operating out of two factories,"	Unclassified
"a national distribution centre and nearly 600 depots, and generating operating profit of £190 million on sales of over £1 billion"	Financial
"The same principles continue to drive our strategic objective of delivering better and better service, person to person, wherever it is required."	Social_Relationship
	
"BUSINESS MODELThe kitchenKitchens are one of the few things we all use every day, no matter where or how we live. Something as important as a kitchen really  has to work, and keep working."	Unclassified
"The kitchen transcends whatever we might be doing in it at any particular moment. It has to cope with people of all ages using it for many purposes: cooking, eating, drinking, washing, ironing, reading, writing, studying, talking, celebrating, commiserating and making plans. Not to mention the baby bashing the table, the dog licking the cabinets and a teenager trying out a new invention on the worktop."	Unclassified
"We place enormous and ever-increasing demands on the kitchen, and we expect it to take them. We also expect that the kitchen will make our lives easier and more enjoyable"	Unclassified
"This is not a new idea. The functionality of the kitchen has been becoming increasingly complex since the Middle Ages. Most of us now understand that a kitchen that looks good and works properly must be installed by a professional fitter, which is why Howdens sells only to builders"	Unclassified
"A newly opened Howdens depot grows business by talking to local builders and opening credit accounts for them.Our depots are typically around 10,000 square feet in size, in industrial locations rather than retail parks, and employ between six and ten staff"	Manufactured
"They are low-cost, both in terms of rent and fit-out, and become profitable when they reach annual sales of £650,000, which they usually do by their second year of operation."	Financial
"Anything, from a tube of glue to a complete kitchen, can be collected by the builder as soon as he needs it. Service is more than initial availability, so all Howdens’ products are designed from scratch to be quick and easy to install as well as fit for purpose and robust in daily use. We undertake to swap anything, locally, right away, if it is no longer needed or something is not quite right."	Unclassified
"We offer builders, and hence end-users, a free kitchen planning service that we believe is second to none, not only because it uses the latest technology but because it is delivered by expert planners on a personal basis"	Intellectual
"Every Howdens kitchen is the result of a series of critical conversations between the people who plan it, buy it, install it and use it. And before that, between the people who design it, source it, make it, test it, photograph it, write about it, pack it and take it to the depot"	Intellectual
"Howdens offers the builder a personal, confidential discount so that he can determine his margin for each job, and a nett monthly credit account, which means the builder can get paid by his customer before he has to pay us."	Social_Relationship
"The builder’s account is held at his local depot, and his discount is agreed between him and the depot manager. Credit control is managed centrally, which has proved to be a highly efficient way of minimising bad debt and supporting personal relationships"	Social_Relationship
"Depot managers, and their staff, are incentivised on a share of their own depot’s profit, less stock loss. There is virtually no  stock loss. Depot staff are entrepreneurial  and accountable."	Human
"Incentives are very important to every part of Howdens’ business, not only to depots. They may relate to specific targets or to outperformance against a range of indicators compared to the previous year’s results. Individuals and teams who deliver outstanding service receive significant, sometimes life-changing, rewards"	Unclassified
	
"Supplying the depotThe depot depends directly on Howdens’ supply operation, which encompasses the sourcing of raw materials and of bought-in product, product development, manufacturing, logistics, warehousing and timely distribution to every Howdens depot"	Unclassified
"This is all owned and controlled by Howdens.We design and manufacture kitchen cabinets and worktops in our own factories in Howden in East Yorkshire and Runcorn in Cheshire. Large volumes, long runs, modern production equipment and efficient working practices mean that Howdens can achieve lowest cost  of production."	Unclassified
"The same principles apply to bought-in product. When we put in a purchase order, it is for large volumes, to our own specifications and, critically, to our own availability requirements. An order from Howdens allows our suppliers to operate more efficiently and plan ahead more easily. It allows us to guarantee availability, quality and price – and thereby service –  to our customers."	Social_Relationship
"This level of service could not be delivered without logistics and systems that work,  and do not fail."	Intellectual
"First, Howdens depot managers interpret their own sales patterns and local knowledge to choose how much product they require. Then, they rely on our truck fleet to deliver it nationwide without delay so that all our depots are always in stock. All of this activity, whether in manufacturing, distribution or sales, is underpinned by a well-invested, robust, stable and scalable systems infrastructure that has plenty of scope to handle significant further growth."	Intellectual
"OPERATING ENVIRONMENTThe builder’s marketFrom the outset, Howdens has been designed around the needs of the small builder.The small builder is an entrepreneur who migrates from one sector of the market to another by recommendation. His customers may be owner-occupiers, private landlords or local developers. Equally, they may be housing associations or local authorities. Sometimes the small builder will fit out a shop, or a studio, or an office, as well as a private home. The pattern of his work will vary from season to season and from year to yea"	Unclassified
"Howdens benefits directly from this flexibility. It is the builder who regulates the mix of end-users, allowing us immediate access, at no extra cost, to all sectors of the marke"	Intellectual
"Today, Howdens ser ves a significant share  of the retail market in the UK without any of the costs, such as showrooms, fitters or home deliver y, that are normally associated with retail."	Unclassified
"What is changing?Our expectations of what is “normal” continue to change. We are less and less prepared to wait for anything. We don’t want to queue for a till or at a helpdesk. We haven’t got time to waste waiting for quotations, plans, deliveries, installation, repairs and someone to answer the phone. We expect service right awa"	Unclassified
"We are also less tolerant of mistakes or things that go wrong. We don’t just want someone to answer the phone, we want a helpful, informed person who can deal with whatever we need, now. We want every product, big or small, to look good, work well and not break. We want clear instructions and correct information"	Unclassified
	
We also expect product to make our lives  easier and easier. This means that product innovation at all price points is an ongoing priority for Howdens	Intellectual
"or most of us, there is also less space. In the home, this means more kitchen designs that make the best use of every available inch. On the roads, this means more builders getting stuck in traffic more often, which means that ideally the nearest Howdens depot is on their doorstep. In our cities, and across the UK, increasing demand for space means we have to have strong property skills and the reflex to think further ahead about our requirements"	Unclassified
"Howdens sells more kitchens than any other player in the UK market. In 2014 we sold around 3.8 million cabinets to nearly 330,000 credit account holders. Since 2008 the number of SKUs, or stock-keeping units, in our business has risen by 100%"	Financial
"So we want to go on delivering constantly improving service to an increasing number of customers, and we will continue to invest in space, systems and resources to manage scale and complexity, service, people and our future."	Social_Relationship
"PROSPECTS CREATE OPPORTUNITIESHowdens works because the idea of the business – to deliver a service of value, person to person, in the one place that is central to our daily lives – is strong enough to appeal to a large and growing number of people, and because we have stuck to our values from the outset in implementing this idea"	Social_Relationship
"When we started Howdens we did not know how many depots we would be able to open. We have continued to open local depots in response to demand, as more and more people become engaged with what Howdens stands for and what this business can do. It is now clear that we have a huge opportunity to deliver Howdens service on an even larger scale, so we plan to go on opening local depots wherever we see good prospects for them"	Manufactured
r	Social_Relationship
We have the opportunity to transform our warehousing and distribution operations in order to meet our need for increased capacity. We plan to invest significantly in this area to ensure that all our depots continue to be always in stock.	Manufactured
"As kitchens become ever more complex, and the digitally connected lifestyle more widespread, we will invest in product innovation, but also in every aspect of product – choice, design, usability, materials technology and manufacturing excellence"	Intellectual
"All of this will also, of course, mean further investment in people. Howdens is an idea that recruits people who want to be part of it – a world in which proper value is placed on personal relationships and where they can do a thorough job"	Human
