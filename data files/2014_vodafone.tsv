"We’ve come a long way since making the first ever mobile call in the UK on 1 January 1985. In 30 years, a small mobile operator in Newbury has grown into a global business and one of the most valuable telecoms brands in the world. We now have mobile operations in 27 countries and partner with mobile networks in 48 more. Today, we have 434 million mobile customers around the world. And because we now do more than just mobile, we’re able to provide fixed broadband services in 17 markets, and 9 million customers use us for their fixed broadband needs"	Social_Relationship
"Our core purpose is to empower our customers to be confidently connected – whether at home, during the daily commute, in the office, or abroad – wherever and however they choose. We want everyone to be confidently connected to their friends, families, and customers, and to always have access to the content and information they choose."	Social_Relationship
"We’re aiming to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, by having the best network, providing the best customer experience and having the best integrated worry-free solutions."	Intellectual
"While we expect these actions to improve our business performance over time, we recognise that financial results alone are not enough. A commitment to improve our social impact and behave ethically and responsibly at all times is integral to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our businesses"	Social_Relationship
"Our business is constantly evolving to adapt to changes in customer behaviour, technology, regulation and the competitive landscape. Our strategy is our response to these changes, while ensuring we operate in a responsible way."	Social_Relationship

"Three pillars of successThree distinct elements sum up why Vodafone has had such a strong track record of shareholder value creation over recent years. First, in response to the increasing demand for data we have formulated a clear strategy of becoming a leading unified communications provider and to strengthen further our network and service differentiation, through investments in mobile and fixed capabilities."	Intellectual
"Second, we have made significant progress in executing our strategy. We have actively managed our portfolio, particularly disposing of our non-controlling interests, and used part of the proceeds to accelerate the roll-out of 3G and 4G mobile capability and the deployment of next-generation fixed line operations in a number of key markets. To accelerate our strategy further we acquired Kabel Deutschland in Germany and agreed the purchase of Ono in Spain – two leading cable companies in their respective markets"	Intellectual
"Finally, we have extended our very strong track record of balancing the long-term needs of the business with significant returns to shareholders. We ended the year in a strong financial position and with a clear strategy for long-term growth"	Financial
Our role in society and protection of customer dataTelecommunications technology has a significant positive impact on economic development and individual wellbeing. We remain committed to enhancing the positive social impact of mobile – our networks and services are used to address everything from illiteracy to supporting the local healthcare infrastructure and realising the potential of budding entrepreneurs.	Social_Relationship
"Our technology helps people to connect and share information. In this context data protection is critical. However, this year there have been a number of troubling allegations about the activities of security agencies in accessing customer data. As a trusted communications service provider, we view our customers’ privacy as absolutely key"	Social_Relationship
"As a demonstration of our commitment to transparency in this regard, our latest sustainability report includes a section on law enforcement disclosure. This explains the nature and extent of government powers to order our assistance, together with information about agency and authority demands in countries where statistical data can lawfully be disclosed."	Social_Relationship
"We are dependent on government policies and regulatory frameworks. While this applies to all our operations, it is critical for the development of a globally competitive and healthy telecom industry in Europe."	Social_Relationship
"Europe needs to find the right balance between protecting consumer interests and the consumer’s long-term interest in investment in next-generation telecom infrastructure and innovation, that will enable future growth and prosperity for its citizens. So far that balance in our opinion has not been found in the proposals for reform of the digital single market currently under consideration in Brussels"	Unclassified
"Alignment with shareholdersOur remuneration policies continue to ensure that management is strongly aligned with shareholders, with a focus on rewarding long-term value creation. After the return of value arising from the sale of our Verizon Wireless stake, Vittorio, and other members of the Executive Committee reinvested a significant proportion of their net proceeds back into Vodafone shares to demonstrate their commitment to the business and the strength of that alignment."

"The Board continues to consider the ordinary dividend to be the core element of shareholder returns, and believes in a consistent dividend policy. This year we raised the dividend per share by 8%, and as a reflection of our confidence in our future performance, we intend to raise it annually hereafter."	Unclassified
"Changes to the Board During the year, Andy Halford informed the Board of his intention to step down as Group CFO. I would like to thank him for his outstanding contribution to Vodafone during his eight year tenure as CFO and in his previous roles. He has brought an invaluable rigour and clarity to our financial reporting and investor communication, while consistently driving significant improvements to our organisational efficiency. I am confident that Nick Read, who joined the Board as CFO on 1 April 2014, will be a worthy successor."	Unclassified
"During the year there were a number of changes to the non-executive team and these are set out in my Governance statement on page 49. My medium-term ambitions for the composition of the Board are to bring in further marketing expertise, and achieve a greater gender balance. By September we will have three female directors and we will be well on our way to our goal of 25% of Board members being women by 2015"	Human

"RevenueMobile consumers pay for our services either via contracts (typically up to two years in length) or through buying their airtime in advance (prepaid). Enterprise customers often have longer contracts. Fixed customers typically pay via one to two year contracts. We have a diverse service revenue stream with 51% from mobile services in Europe, 30% from mobile operations in AMAP, 15% from fixed services and the remainder from other items such as MVNO agreements. Within our mobile business, 51% of annual service revenue arises from consumers’ monthly price plans, which we call in-bundled revenue. In-bundled revenue is an increasing proportion of our business and is relatively stable compared to out-of-bundle revenue, which is much more vulnerable to competitive and economic pressure."

"Cash flowOur track record of converting revenue into cash flow is strong – with some £16 billion generated over the last three years. We achieve this by operating efficient networks where we seek to minimise costs, thus supporting our gross margin.

"The  telecommunications  industry  todayThe fixed and mobile telecommunications industry is a large and important sector, generating around US$1.5 trillion of revenue. Today there are  seven billion mobile users and over 650 million fixed customers"	Financial
"Scale and structureThe mobile industry alone has seven billion users, generating over US$960 billion of annual service revenue every year. The majority of revenue comes from traditional calls and texts (for example, last year 7,800 billion texts were sent around the world last year). However, over the last few years the demand for data services, such as internet browsing on a smartphone, has accelerated, and today around 28% of mobile revenue is from data, up from 13% in 2009"	Financial
"Around 74% of mobile users are in emerging markets, such as India and Africa, reflecting the typical combination of large populations and the lack of fixed line infrastructure. The remaining users are from wealthier mature markets, such as Europe. However, the proportion of the population with a phone – or mobile penetration – tends to be higher in mature markets (usually over 100%) and lower in emerging markets, particularly in rural areas, due mainly to lower incomes and less network coverage"	Unclassified
"GrowthThe demand for mobile services continues to grow strongly. In the last three years the number of users increased by an average of 9% each year. In 2009 global mobile penetration was only 69%, and by 2013 it had risen to 98%. Most of the increase in users has been from emerging markets due to favourable growth drivers – young and expanding populations, faster economic growth, low but rising mobile penetration, and less fixed line infrastructure. The other key area of growth is data, which is being driven by increasing smartphone and tablet penetration, better mobile networks, and an increased choice of internet content and applications (‘apps’)"	Unclassified
"CompetitionThe mobile industry is highly competitive, with many alternative providers, giving customers a wide choice of supplier. In each country there are typically at least three to four mobile network operators (‘MNOs’), such as Vodafone. In addition, there can be numerous mobile virtual network operators (‘MVNOs’) – suppliers that rent capacity from mobile operators to sell on to their customers. There can also be competition from internet-based companies and software providers that offer alternative communication services such as voice over internet protocol (‘VoIP’) or instant messaging services"	Intellectual
"RegulationThe mobile industry is very heavily regulated by national and supranational authorities. Regulators continue to lower mobile termination rates (‘MTRs’) which are the fees mobile companies charge for calls received from other companies’ networks, and to limit the amount that operators can charge for mobile roaming services"	Unclassified
"These two areas represent around 12% of service revenue for Vodafone.Revenue trendsIn an environment of intense competition and significant regulatory pressures, the price of mobile services has tended to reduce over time. However, with both more mobile phone users, mainly in emerging markets, and more data usage, global mobile revenue remains on a positive trend and expanded by 2% in 2013"	Financial
"The global fixed marketThe fixed communications market is valued at around US$500 billion. Over the last three years, revenue from voice services has declined as the demand for traditional fixed line calls has remained static at around one billion users. In contrast, revenue from fixed broadband or internet usage on the PC is growing with an estimated 650 million customers worldwide – an increase of nearly 30% over the last three years. This growth has been spread across all forms of broadband – DSL (copper), cable and fibre, and within this, there is a growing preference for the high speed capability provided by cable and fibre"	Financial
	
"Overcoming  barriers  to  mobile  ownership  for  women  in  emerging  markets Our Connected Women report looked at the gender gap in mobile phone ownership in emerging economies and the social and economic impact of extending women’s access to mobile phones. Vodafone Turkey launched the Vodafone Women First programme in 2013, which combines promotional offers with services that help women to increase their income, use mobile technology and acquire new skills. Launched in 2013, it attracted 75,000 women customers in its first nine months, of which 15% were new customers for Vodafone"	Social_Relationship
	
"Growing importance of data and other new revenue areasMobile voice and texts, our traditional revenue sources, have reached maturity in a number of markets. To deliver future growth opportunities, we are investing in newer revenue areas such as data. It is estimated that between 2013 and 2017 data revenue for the telecommunications sector is set to grow by US$128 billion, compared to a US$38 billion decline in voice revenue over the same period."	Financial
"The demand for data will continue to be driven by rising smartphone and tablet penetration and usage, and improvements in mobile network capability. As the demand for data grows, mobile networks have to be reconfigured to data, while still meeting the need for traditional texts and calls. Already 91% of the world’s total traffic on mobile networks is data. The data services most used are video streaming and internet browsing which require high speed networks. Therefore, we are investing in ultrafast 4G with average download speeds of over 75Mbps today, and the expectation of faster speeds, of up to 300Mbps, by the end of calendar 2014"	Unclassified
"ew applications for mobile services are being developed by the industry to extend the use of mobile beyond everyday communication and deliver new revenue streams, such as mobile payments via a handset or machine-to-machine services, including the location monitoring of vehicles, through a SIM card embedded in the vehicle"	Unclassified
"Convergence of fixed and mobile into unified communicationsWe expect a continued trend towards unified communications such as bundled mobile, fixed and TV services. These provide a range of benefits for the user, including simplicity, flexibility and cost savings. The demand for these services is already established among enterprise customers and it is now becoming more visible in the consumer market, particularly in southern European markets, such as Spain. We believe that this demand, combined with technological advances delivering easier connection of multiple data devices, will support strong data growth in future, and that this will need to be managed by access to next-generation fixed networks, principally cable or fibre, to support increased speed and capacity demands"	Intellectual
"Strong demand from emerging marketsEmerging markets have the most potential for future mobile customer and revenue growth driven by rising populations, strong economic growth, lower mobile penetration and a lack of alternative fixed line infrastructure. According to industry analysts, by 2017 there will be 1.7 billion new mobile users across the globe, and most will be from emerging markets. As a result by 2017, 77% of the world’s mobile users will be from these markets"	Unclassified
"ncreasing range of competitorsThe high level of competition among established MNOs is expected to continue. However, there is also a wider pool of new competitors. Alternative communication technologies, such as instant messaging services which use data, rather than traditional voice and text, are increasingly used by mobile consumers. In response, operators have begun to replace per unit charges for voice and text services with unlimited bundles, and combine this with a fixed fee for data usage. Meanwhile MVNOs which offer low prices, but have little capital invested, have in recent periods taken share from established capital intensive operators. However, the move to 4G and unified communications presents an opportunity for the major operators to differentiate the quality of their networks and service"	Intellectual
Regulation will continue to have a significant impactThe industry is expected to see continued downward revenue pressure from regulation. For example the Europe Commission is seeking the removal of all roaming surcharges after 2016 (for Vodafone roaming accounts for around 6% of European service revenue).	Financial
"In contrast, Commission proposals to harmonise the speed at which Member States roll out spectrum and the duration of contracts, should encourage investment. In our largest emerging market, India, the regulatory framework is becoming clearer"	Intellectual
"mproving economic environment in EuropeThe economic recession in Europe over the last two years has been a key driver of the declining revenue trends in Europe for many operators.

"Vodafone Red enabling worry-free usageVodafone Red offers unlimited calls and texts with generous data allowances – enabling our customers to use their smartphones worry-free. We already have 12 million users across 20 markets and 37% of new contract customers join on Red plans. Our research shows that Red customers are more likely to recommend us to their friends and family and we are seeing early signs that they are less likely to leave us for another operator. Red also helps us protect our revenue, with 58% of our European mobile service revenue now in-bundle compared to 51% a year ago, and it reduces the risk to our business from over‑the‑top service"	Intellectual
"Delivering an unmatched customer experienceWe are modernising around 8,000 of our stores to a new format that enables customers to interact with us in a more engaging way and these stores have been seen to increase transactions by more than 5%. We have already upgraded over 1,100 stores and Project Spring will accelerate our plans to modernise the remaining stores by March 2016. We are also upgrading our customer service, with all of our call centres across Europe now offering “24/7” service and we have expanded our “self-care” solutions online and on mobile"	Intellectual
"4G driving increased data usage and engagementAlthough most of our customers are using 2G and 3G services, we are seeing increased demand for 4G services, with 4.7 million customers across 14 markets. 4G is attractive because it offers much faster speeds and a better user experience and as a result our 4G customers use on average twice as much data as our 3G user"	Intellectual
"By adding attractive content such as music and sport packages with 4G plans we believe we can drive growth in both data usage and revenue. In the UK for example, 4G plans are generating 18% more ARPU versus comparable 3G plans and customers are using 2.3 times more data."	Financial
"Fixed and unified communicationsConsumers increasingly want unified communications as they benefit from one plan that includes their fixed and mobile connections and in some cases TV package as well.

"What is unified communications? As customer demand for ubiquitous data and content grows rapidly over the coming years, the most successful communications providers will be the ones who can provide seamless high speed connectivity at home, at work, at play and anywhere in between. This will require the integration of multiple technologies – 3G, 4G, WiFi, cable and fibre – into a single meshed network offering the best, uninterrupted experience – what we call “unified communications"	Intellectual
"With the acquisition of Cable & Wireless Worldwide in 2012, we have made a step change in our ability to offer unified communications services to customers in the UK and gained an extensive international footprint. After successfully integrating sales forces this year, we are now beginning to build a strong pipeline of new business"	Intellectual
"Unified communications for consumersOver the last few years, we have seen a significant move towards bundling of fixed and mobile products for residential customers, often including television in the package as well. Of our markets, Spain and Portugal are the most advanced in this regard, but we expect it to become prevalent in all our major European markets. This presents us with a clear opportunity, as our share of fixed services in our European markets is under 10%, whereas our share of the mobile market is well over 25%. In addition, mobile customer churn is typically three times higher than that of customers taking combined fixed and mobile services."	Unclassified
Our goal is to secure access to next‑generation fixed line infrastructure in all our major European markets.	Intellectual
"Our approach is market-by-market, based on the cost of building our own fibre, the openness of the incumbent provider to reasonable wholesale terms, the speed of market development, and the availability of good quality businesses to acquire. The table below shows the progress we have made this year. We have made significant strides in most of our major markets, through three routes to market – wholesaling (or renting), our own fibre deployment, or acquisitions. In particular, the acquisition of Kabel Deutschland and the proposed purchase of Ono will significantly strengthen our position in Germany and Spain respectively. At the year end, we had nine million fixed broadband customers, and the proposed acquisition of Ono will increase this to 11 million."	Manufactured
"Outside Europe, we acquired TelstraClear in New Zealand, the second largest fixed operator, in 2012 to strengthen our portfolio of fixed products and services and create a leading total communications company. We also intend to expand selectively high speed fibre services to urban areas in emerging markets to enable converged services in key business areas.

"Driving the mobile penetration opportunityThe number of customers in our emerging markets has grown steadily and rapidly from 185 million, 57% of the Group total three years ago, to around 302 million, representing 70% of the total today. This has been driven by fast economic growth and rising populations. In our largest emerging market, India, the proportion of the 1.2 billion population with a mobile, commonly known as mobile penetration, is still only 78%, so we expect to see a lot more growth going forward"	Unclassified
"We have invested significantly in our emerging markets to support and drive this growth opportunity. We have expanded network coverage by 8% to 161,500 base station sites, providing us with significant scale and broad coverage. We have increased the range of low cost Vodafone branded devices, enabling more people on low incomes to access mobile services. We have also lowered the cost of calls, with prices as low as one US cent per minute in India, which, along with greater network coverage, has helped drive growth in both the number users and mobile usage."	Intellectual
"The data opportunityWhile mobile data usage to browse the internet or watch videos is increasingly common in Europe, it is still at an early stage in emerging markets. However, it is expanding quickly due to the growth in customers and also the greater range and affordability of handsets. In India, for example, the number of data users increased by 13 million to 52 million over the course of last year. In Turkey, we now have 6.5 million smartphone users, up from 3.1 million only two years ago. Outside South Africa, in our smaller southern African markets of Tanzania, Lesotho, Mozambique and the DRC, the number of data customers increased 86% to 7.7 million taking the total active data customer base to 30% of total customers"	Unclassified

"Though we continue to extend the reach of our network to more customers, who are using increasing amounts of data, our own carbon footprint has remained almost stable and we remain committed to reduce it as far as possible through energy efficiency measures. The efficiency of our operations has greatly improved with emissions per base station now at ten tonnes CO2e, almost 40% lower than in 2007. Our total carbon emissions in 2014 were 2.55 million tonnes of CO2e, a slight increase on 2013 due to newly acquired operations"	Natural

Performance for the year was driven by intense price competition in both the consumer and enterprise segments and an MTR cut effective from December 2012, with Vodafone particularly impacted due to our traditionally high ARPU. In a more competitive environment we launched both a more aggressive 3G price plan (“Smart”) and pushed otelo in the entry-level contract segment.
