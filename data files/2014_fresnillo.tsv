"“ Targeted investment, disciplined cash management, and a commitment to shared value."	Financial
"As always, we will focus on operational excellence by seeking additional efficiencies, investing in productivity and controlling costs to maintain our cost position and world-class margins.”Octavio AlvídrezChief Executive Office"	Financial
Our mines are set to yield returns even in a low metal price environment	Financial
	
"When I first entered the mining industry, the typical price cycle was fairly predictable: rising demand led to higher prices, which encouraged producers to expand capacity; then eventually rising inventories led back to softer prices. Today, however, we see another set of fundamentals driving precious metal prices: global macroeconomic conditions that influence exchange-traded funds and investment demand for metal"	Financial
"Case in point: the Fed’s tapering programme and expected rate hike, as well as the strengthening of the US dollar, put downward pressure on gold and silver prices in 2014. While there was no shortage of geopolitical risk in the year, which may have offered price support to gold in the past given its safe haven status, the impact was muted compared to prior periods of turmoil"	Unclassified
"Strategy drives value creationWith price cycles much less predictable now, a company’s strategy, business model and execution have become the barometers of value-creation and longevity. We know that sheer size alone does not determine success – but that operational excellence, targeted investment, disciplined cash management, and a commitment to shared value just may. In that regard, I remain confident  that we are on the right path"	Unclassified
"or Fresnillo, production goals have always been set according to our ability to profitably maximise operations, develop new projects and build the growth pipeline, rather than as a straight response to market dynamics. Our value chain sets strategic relationships directly in the centre, with the recognition that shared value creates the support required to sustain our business mode"	Unclassified
"How is this reflected in our performance? By design, our mines are set to yield returns even in a low metal price environment. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) on a life of mine basis in most of our mines are amongst the lowest in the industry, and in most cases significantly lower than current and projected market prices for gold and silver. This is a clear competitive advantage, as it allows us to maintain operating continuity in times of depressed prices."	Intellectual
"In 2014 we continued to generate solid profit margins at our silver underground mines, whilst profit margins at our gold open pit mines were reasonable considering the temporarily higher stripping ratios and lower gold prices"	Financial
"Our high-potential development projects meet stringent criteria for mineral content and embedded costs from the start. Thus Saucito II and San Julián, which advanced according to plan this year, are expected to contribute to our future profitable grow"	Intellectual
"Exploration remains core to our organic growth strategy and a key element in extending mine life; by investing through the price cycle, we saw gold and silver reserves increase by 45.0% and 21.3% respectively over 2013 leve"	Manufactured
"Challenge creates opportunityThis is not to say we did not encounter internal challenges in the year. However, as I lay out below, these have in fact provided us with an opportunity to adapt, innovate, modify and enhance our operations such that our long-term outlook is secur"	Intellectual
"he first key challenge was at the Fresnillo mine, where we faced the natural and expected decline of silver ore grades; this was further exacerbated by dilution due to rock conditions and a delay in development activities as a result of mechanical failures with contractor equipment, limiting access to some stopes in the first quarter of the yea"	Intellectual
"Combined, these factors clearly had an impact on the mine’s silver production, down 11.7% year on year, but it also prompted us to adjust mining methods, change drilling layouts, bring in new contractors, and implement stricter controls on development rates, all of which will support production volumes next year. Furthermore, cost per tonne decreased in the year as a result of our efficiency initiatives and greater economies of scale."	Intellectual
"econd, as you may recall, we entered 2014 with a suspended explosives permit at our subsidiary Minera Penmont, arising from the legal challenge raised by the Ejido El Bajío agrarian community in 2013, who contested the ownership of the surface land of the Dipolos pit and the beneficiation plant of the Soledad-Dipolos mine. The resolution of this case ultimately led to a full suspension of mining and beneficiation activities at Soledad-Dipolos and halted mining activity at Herradura until March 2014"	Social_Relationship
"As gold production ramped up again at Herradura, the new dynamic leaching plant concurrently reached full-scale operations, albeit with technical issues involving an excess of solids in solution. We recognised that processing capacity at Herradura would have to be enhanced in"	Intellectual

"Construction of Saucito II was completed on time and on budget, and the new mine formally commenced operations in December. This US$235 million project is anticipated to produce 8.4 million ounces of silver and 35,000 ounces of gold per year once it reaches full capacity, which we now expect to happen ahead of the previously indicated three-year timeframe. The San Julián project is progressing as expected and remains on track to start production in the fourth quarter of 2015. This US$515.0 million silver-gold project is expected to produce an average of 10.3 million ounces of silver and 44,000 ounces of gold per year once at full capacity"	Intellectual
"We allocated US$184.5 million to exploration during the year. While this was somewhat below the original budget, we identified a number of promising new targets in the mining districts where we operate, an approach that has proven to deliver cost-effective discoveries as infrastructure is already in place. We also explored in other high-potential districts where initial drilling was successful. We are particularly excited about results obtained in the Herradura District and at Orisyvo and Guanajuato."	Intellectual
"The increase in total reserves included a significant conversion of resources into reserves, most notably 162 million ounces of silver and 533 thousand ounces of gold at San Julián, and 2.5 million ounces of gold at Herradura, the latter following an intensive infill drilling campaign and the revised parameters in calculating the deep ore in the pit. Total gold resources increased 1.7% while silver resources declined 6.2% due to lower price assumptions and the conversion of resources into reserves."	Manufactured
"Full ownership of the Penmont assets, progress on development projects and the increase in reserves uphold our view that Fresnillo is well positioned to address cyclical challenges while delivering long-term value creation"	Intellectual
"Financial performanceThe Group’s financial performance was negatively impacted by the decline in precious metal prices. Our average realised silver and gold prices decreased by 18.4% and 10.2% respectively compared to 2013. We were also affected by the reduced sales volumes of gold resulting from the suspended operations at Soledad-Dipolos and the temporary halt in production at Herradura. The combined impact of these factors drove adjusted revenues down by 12.3% to US$1,545.0 million."	Financial
"order to efficiently process the solution produced at both the leaching pads and the dynamic leaching plant and thus enable us to achieve our long-term targets. Our focus at Herradura is three-fold for 2015: the installation of a second Merrill Crowe plant, relocated from our currently inactive operations at Soledad-Dipolos, additional investment to increase the solution processing capacity, and technical modifications to the dynamic leaching plant. Combined, these are expected to allow this mine to achieve steady state production by the fourth quarter of 2015"	Manufactured
"Strengthening our precious metals positionWe went on to significantly bolster our gold outlook during the year. In October we acquired Newmont Mining’s 44% interest in Penmont (and associated companies), allowing us to take full ownership of the assets we already operated, and strengthening our regional footprint in one of Mexico’s richest gold belts. Not only was the US$450 million transaction immediately accretive to net asset value, it also allowed us to increase our 2018 production target from 500,000 ounces to 750,000 ounces. Our 2018 silver production target of 65 million ounces remains in place."	Manufactured
"We made progress towards those ambitious goals this year. Silver production including the Silverstream of 45.0 million ounces came in 4.9% ahead of guidance. The aforementioned decline at Fresnillo was mitigated by increased throughput at Saucito, with additional ore processed from development activities at Saucito II, as well as increased production from the Silverstream"	Unclassified
"Gold production of 596 thousand ounces reflected the stoppage at Soledad-Dipolos and the temporary disruptions at Herradura, mitigated by the acquisition of the Penmont assets. This figure was slightly above our revised target, which had taken into account the delay in ramp-up at Herradura due to the aforementioned technical issues and capacity constraints."	Intellectual
	
"HSECR performance, and a revised risk assessmentWe know that robust sustainability practices make good business sense on multiple levels: along with underpinning our licence to operate, they lower operating risk and often drive better operating performance overall. We see the Group’s HSECR strategy as essential to creating long-term value"	Social_Relationship
"But there is still work to be done on a number of fronts, most vitally to fulfil our zero fatality commitment. To reinforce our safety efforts, we launched a new programme focusing on the human factors involved in the majority of incidents and injuries. This complements the Group’s ‘No More Accidents’ programme and a range of initiatives aimed at embedding safety in our culture. Indeed, we must ensure that our workplace culture places adherence to safety above all other outcomes. I remain personally committed to improving our indicators in 201"	Social_Relationship
"Our environmental performance in energy and greenhouse gas emissions largely reflected longer haulage distances and the start-up of the dynamic leaching plant, although good progress was made in water utilisation rates. In fact, our water footprints per ounce of silver at Saucito and Fresnillo are among the best in the industry"	Natural
"hankfully, our track record on environmental incidents remains solid, but by no means are we immune from the consequences of such events that befall others in our industry. In 2014, several environmental incidents occurred. As a result of these incidents, amendments to Mexican laws on environmental liability have been proposed with a view to raising sanctions on violations, from higher fines to permanent suspensions of mining concessions. As a result, we have elevated the risk rating of potential actions by the government (see ‘2014 risk assessments’ pages 43-45)"	Social_Relationship
"Adjusted production costs increased 19.4% due to higher variable costs recorded as a result of the resumed operations at Herradura; the start-up of the dynamic leaching plant; the temporarily higher stripping ratios at Herradura and Noche Buena; and the increased volumes processed at a number of our mines. These were partially mitigated by the efficiencies achieved at several of our mines, costs not incurred at Soledad-Dipolos, and the favourable impact of the 4.1% devaluation of the average Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate."	Intellectual
"Gross profit decreased by 32.1% to US$521.1 million. Reduced exploration expenses helped narrow the decline in EBITDA to 22.3%, while the EBITDA margin decreased from 45.2% to a still robust 40.1%.The revaluation effect of the Silverstream Contract was a US$77.0 million gain to the Group’s financial results despite lower silver price assumptions, reflecting a number of factors including increased resource grade at Sabinas, a lower discount rate, better than expected production in 2014 and unwinding of the discount."	Financial
"ncome tax expense declined by 2.7% as a result of lower profits generated in the year, offset by an increase in deferred income taxes generated by the greater differences arising between the carrying value of assets and liabilities (denominated in US dollars) and their tax bases (denominated in Mexican pesos).

Working capital increased US$183.4 million due to an increase in income tax and VAT receivables and higher volumes sold to Met-Mex; and higher inventories in the Herradura Distric"	Financial
"Capital expenditures totalled US$425.6 million, a decrease of 25.6%, with investments primarily allocated to construction of the Saucito II and San Julián projects, purchase of components for mobile equipment at Herradura and Fresnillo, development works at Saucito and Ciénega, and construction of leaching pads at Noche Buena"	Manufactured
	
"A look ahead at 2015While our strategic objectives remain unchanged, we must be sensitive to market dynamics as they relate to our budgeting and cash management strategies. For 2015 we have given priority to optimising output from the Fresnillo and Ciénega mines, ramping up Saucito II, delivering San Julián on time and on budget, advancing our assessment of Orisyvo, evaluating mine plan options for Mega Centauro as the natural evolution of Herradura’s Centauro pit, and progressing our advanced exploration projects"	Social_Relationship
"We will continue to monitor changes to our operating assumptions, always favouring actions that accelerate cash flow and deferring expenditures that do not sacrifice the optimal timing of our projects. Our current expected capex outlay for the year is in the region of US$700 million, while risk capital to be invested in exploration is budgeted at around US$170 million. We believe our current balance sheet is well placed to meet these plans and still provide us with sufficient flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise"	Intellectual
"As always, we will focus on operational excellence by seeking additional efficiencies, investing in productivity and controlling costs to maintain our cost position and world-class margins.I have tremendous respect and gratitude for our suppliers, contractors, clients and other stakeholders and especially for our people and communities, whose wellbeing we will continue to prioritise in all that we do. Our belief in creating shared value for all our stakeholders helps drive our strategy and gives me confidence in our ability to deliver returns in 2015 and beyond."	Social_Relationship
"Unsurprisingly, the impacts of these incidents extended to the social sphere. Multiple organisations called for the closure of related mining operations and launched acts of civil defiance to pressure authorities. We felt this warranted the elevation of the public perception against mining risk as we"	Unclassified
"I would like to state unequivocally that Fresnillo supports its communities’ rights, not just to environmental health but also to the due benefits of a strategic partner. In 2014 we conducted our biennial community perception and reputation survey, and for the first time included focus groups in the formal consultation process of reviewing and enhancing our community investment strategy and policies."	Social_Relationship
"We are now taking a fresh look at how we approach community relations, and have brought in an external consultant to support this effort. In line with our commitment to adopting international best practices – as delineated by such organisations as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), we will provide detailed information as we progress with that effort. As well as putting in place policies designed to enhance stakeholder engagement and community development, we are exploring the possibility of a public health programme. Although still in its discovery phase, this programme links silver to the production of safe drinking water, in line with the soon-to-be-published United Nations 2015 Sustainable Development Goals. This initiative, which positively connects mining to a humanitarian cause, is meant to serve both as an emblem and as an inspiration for Fresnillo’s general sustainability plan"	Social_Relationship
"Even as we seek to understand and meet changing community expectations, mining companies in Mexico have continued to face a rise in the number of conflicts with local landowners, as with our own experience in the Penmont litigation of 2013. Our approach is always to ensure respectful land acquisition processes and grievance mechanisms, but we recognise that access to land is a rising strategic risk"	Social_Relationship
"As one of the leading precious metals companies, we aspire to have a well-established ethics culture within Fresnillo. In 2014 we implemented an Ethics and Integrity Programme guided by UK best practices, which incorporates the Group’s values and Code of Conduct, and supports decision-making at all levels of the organisation. All executives, senior and middle managers, employees and key contractors have participated in workshops"	Social_Relationship

"n 2014, increased geopolitical tensions and growth concerns in the first half of the year supported a rise in the gold price, but a stronger dollar and weaker oil prices put downward pressure on gold in the second half, with continued ETF outflows, limited central bank purchases and de-stocking by China. However, prices inched up again at year end, as India rescinded its controls on gold imports, and despite Switzerland voting against a proposal to boost its gold reserves"	Unclassified
"Mine output accounts for the majority of the global gold supply, with the remainder coming from recycling. In a weak price environment, recycling flows are depressed and many miners cannot produce profitably; such supply constraints may once again drive positive investor sentiment.Our mining experience and long view of the cyclical nature of the precious metals industry gives us confidence that the core drivers for demand will prevail, notwithstanding the material impact of metal price declines on our financial performance in 2014."

Concession holders must negotiate private agreements with landowners, including communally held land as recorded in the National Agrarian Registry.

A number of high profile conflicts with landowners occurred in 2014 – albeit with no new cases affecting Fresnillo plc during the year – regarding issues such as renegotiation of land agreements, increased rent for land and water supply and occupancy agreements, some of which resulted in temporary suspension of mining activitie"	Unclassified

"To comply with the Cyanide Code, we purchase sodium cyanide exclusively from ICMI-certified manufacturers, and it is transported and delivered to our facilities by ICMI-certified transporters, following appropriate protocols.

Liquid sodium cyanide (~30% aqueous solution) is transported in tanker trucks and off-loaded on-site into our storage tank. Solid briquettes (~98% purity) are transported in ISO-containers designed so that the cyanide can be safely dissolved in a high-pH solution. The high pH value of cyanide solutions is maintained during dissolution to prevent the volatilisation of hazardous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas. The resulting solution is then pumped to our storage tank. We apply strict health and safety measures throughout the unloading of sodium cyanide to prevent spills and any exposure of our employees and contractors to cyanide. Likewise, we mobilise our response teams to be ready to contain releases or respond to any incidents of cyanide exposure"	Natural
"Gold is extracted by heap and dynamic leaching processes. In heap leaching, the ore is stacked in layers on an impermeable membrane known as a leach pad. The cyanide solution – water containing a very low concentration of sodium cyanide (~0.05%) – is dripped onto the heap by a drip irrigation system. The solution percolates through the heap, leaching the gold from the ore. The leach pad is made of an impermeable liner cover made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to recover the pregnant solution and protect groundwater from seepage. The pH is controlled throughout the process (pH > 10.5 – strongly alkaline) using lime to ensure that when the cyanide solution is added, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas is not generated and cyanide remains in solution, ready to dissolve the gold. The resultant gold-bearing solution is collected on the leach pad and channelled to the Merrill Crowe plant for further processing"	Natural

"Fresnillo plc’s Centre for Technical Studies (CETEF) was created to train high quality mining technicians for our specific needs. Candidates for CETEF are chosen from the communities surrounding our operations as we favour local employment to secure the talent pipeline. Our training approach is based on a hands-on model, whereby students spend 20% of the time studying theory and 80% practising on modern equipment. We also have an agreement with Peñoles to send our candidates to their Centre for Technical Studies at Laguna del Rey (CETLAR), which follows a similar approach to CETEF but focuses on training maintenance technicians"	Human

"Gross profitGross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses, is a key financial indicator of profitability at each business unit and the Fresnillo Group as a whole.Total gross profit, net of hedging gains and losses, decreased 32.1% to US$521.1 million in 2014 (see table below).The main factors contributing to the US$246.4 million decrease in gross profit were: i) the adverse effect of lower silver, gold and lead prices (–US$237.1 million); ii) higher depreciation (–US$66.5 million); iii) the expected lower gold and silver grade at Ciénega (–US$64.1 million); iv) profit lost at Soledad-Dipolos as a result of the stoppage (–US$42.2 million); v) the 9.4% decrease in silver grade at the Fresnillo mine (–US$41.5 million); vi) a 26% increase in the stripping ratio at Noche Buena and 37% at Herradura (–US$31.7 million); vii) the 1.6% cost inflation (–US$16.7 million); and viii) the negative impact of the halted operations at Herradura in the first three months of the year (–US$10.1 milli"	Financial

"n a per mine basis, gross profit at the Fresnillo mine decreased 34.7% to US$206.7 million in 2014, but remained the largest contributor to the Group’s consolidated gross profit, at 36.4%. Saucito’s contribution to the Group’s gross profit continued to increase, rising from 24.2% in 2013 to 33.3% in 2014 due to the on-going ramp-up of production and the additional ore processed from the development works at Saucito II. Notwithstanding, the adverse effect of lower precious metal prices limited the mine’s increase in gross profit to 4.2% over the previous year. Gross profit at Herradura increased 7.3% to US$136.2 million in 2014, which represented 24.0% of the Group’s consolidated gross profit, reflecting the positive effect of the resumed operations. The decrease in gold and silver ounces sold at Ciénega at lower prices led to a 56.9% decline in gross profit for the year, which reduced its share of the Group’s total to 7.2%. Lastly, at Noche Buena, the favourable effect of higher gold volumes produced and sold did not fully mitigate the impact of lower gold price and higher costs, decreasing gross profit at this mine 38.5% and contributing only 2.0% to the consolidated gross profi"	Financial
"he increase in cash cost was primarily explained by the expected decrease in gold grade (+US$157.02 per ounce); the lower by-product credits per ounce of gold due to the reduced volumes of silver and lead sold at lower prices (+US$107.68 per ounce); and to a lesser extent, the increase in cost per tonne (+US$8.82 per ounce). These adverse factors were mitigated by the lower silver refining charges (–US$12.50 per ounce) and lower profit sharing (–US$10.71 per ounce)"	Unclassified
he decrease in cash cost resulted from: i) the 18.0% increase in gold grades (–US$120.55 per ounce); ii) the contribution of additional gold ounces following the start-up of the dynamic leaching plant (–US$58.80 per ounce); iii) additional gold ounces recovered at the leaching process once the inventories on the pads were depleted (–US$22.20 per ounce); iv) the increased by-product credits (–US$20.72 per ounce); v) the lower unproductive costs recorded in relation to the stoppage versus those in the prior year (–US$11.25 per ounce); vi) efficiencies obtained by higher recovery rate and increased speed of recovery (–US$7.72 per ounce); and vii) lower profit sharing (–US$6.43 per ounce).

These adverse effects were partially mitigated by: i) lower carrying costs from previous layers, which benefit the average cost at which the gold ounces are being sold in the current year (–US$163.50 per ounce; ii) not incurring unproductive costs this year compared to the previous year (–US$63.71 per ounce); iii) higher by-product silver credits (–US$4.95 per ounce); and iv) lower refining charges per ounce (–US$1.54 per ounce"	Financial

"xploration expensesExploration expenses in 2014 totalled US$168.8 million, an 18.8% decrease over 2013, as a result of the decision to reduce the expenditure given the decline in precious metal prices. As planned, priority was given to areas within our current mining districts as well as advanced exploration projects and prospects with the highest potential based on previous exploration results. Good results were obtained in the Herradura District, Rodeo and Guanajuato; and resources were converted into reserves mainly at San Julián and Saucito, although the lower price assumptions offset the latter effect (See ‘Exploration’ pages 73-79). An additional US$15.7 million was recorded in association with minor equipment acquired at the Centauro Deep and Orisyvo projects and mining works at Juanicipio. Furthermore, costs for exploration and drilling came down substantially, which allowed for similar rates of advancement at a lower investment.
