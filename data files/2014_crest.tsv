"he surge in demand was not without consequences and like the rest of the sector we had to deal with a shortage of bricks, blocks and other materials as suppliers struggled to respond to increasing levels of output.

We were pleased to regain our 5-star rating for customer satisfaction this year.

"The Group has very few homes in its development pipeline that would be expected to sell for values in excess of £2m and therefore does not anticipate any adverse impact from  the possible introduction of a ‘mansion tax’ at that level.The main constraints on volume delivery and growth relate to supply chain/production capacity (materials, labour, skills) and the clearance of sometimes onerous planning conditions to allow site starts"	Unclassified

"PlanningThe planning regime has a major impact on the location, form, scale and rate at which new housing sites can be brought forward.

Approximately 230,000 houses were consented in England  in the last 12 months: a rate not achieved  since 2007"	Unclassified
"Despite this, the rise in the rate of consents is lowest in the South East and the number of consented sites (rather than plots) remains low"	Unclassified

"Overall, planning remains a significant entry barrier to the house building industry in terms of time, cost and complexity. This is a huge challenge to policymakers as, without an increase in the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) sector (which has reduced from 12,000 companies to about 3,000 over the last 25 years), housing delivery will continue to fail to meet demand. The Group remains strongly focused on increasing the supply and value of its short- and long-term development pipeline and most of its land for 2015 and 2016 housing delivery is already permissioned"	Unclassified

"Housing standardsThe Government is consulting to harmonise and reduce the number of different local standards that councils apply.

"Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) CIL was intended to increase the transparency of development and replace the contributions currently made through s106 agreements. Take-up by local authorities has been slower than planned, and the CIL has proved complex in practice as the economics of local housing markets and site typologies vary widely. For example, an acceptable levy on a simple greenfield site may well prohibit development on a complex brownfield site. The CIL payment can also add significantly to upfront development costs making cash flow for smaller developers more challenging"	Unclassified
"Zero carbonThe Government maintains that it is committed to a zero carbon standard for all new homes  consented after 2016, but this target is very challenging given that policy-making is running well behind what would be considered a reasonable timeframe for the level of change the industry will face. Greater definition is needed quickly around Allowable Solutions (the likely regime for off-site carbon mitigation) and the related cost per tonne of carbon, which directly impact the design and carbon abatement cost of future homes. The Group continues to play an active part in zero carbon policy formation and remains focused on planning how it will meet  the Government’s carbon reduction timeline  and objectives"	Natural

"This year we launched the Crest Nicholson Quality Manual and a strengthened inspection and sign-off procedure for build stages. The manual sets out our benchmark quality standard – and ‘Gold Standards’ – for workmanship and materials, and is concise and pictorial, with clear notes for specific trades and subcontractors. The content focuses on the pitfalls affecting build quality and finish to help site teams identify issues contributing to the DvAB performance gap."	Unclassified
"The Quality Manual is sent to all subcontractors at tender stage so that returns are priced against the workmanship standards it sets out.
