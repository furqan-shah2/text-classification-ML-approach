Since the launch of our first smar tcard in 2011 around 550,000 people have switched to ‘the key’, which is used across all of our large bus operations.  In less than two years, over 130,000 people have downloaded our m-ticketing bus app to their mobile phones"	Intellectual

Working with TfL in this industr y first, we will be extending this  to allow customers to use our smar tcard on London Underground ser vices, with a pilot scheme planned for later this year.

In addition to planning journeys, passengers can buy tickets and even claim compensation  if their train is delayed. In the first three months alone 100,000 people downloaded ‘On Track’ and take up has continued to grow, with close  to 150,000 people now using the app"	Intellectual

In 2012, we announced our pilot scheme using  flywheel technology. This has been a great success and has directly contributed to us securing two London bus contracts. Over the next two to three years  we have plans to introduce flywheel systems to 500 additional buses, resulting in over 10% of our fleet being powered by this leading edge technology.

"How the gyrodrive flywheel worksThe gyrodrive system uses a high speed flywheel made of carbon  fibre to store the energy generated by a bus as it slows down to stop. The flywheel works as a ‘regenerative brake’ absorbing kinetic energy  and slowing the vehicle down. When the bus star ts up again, the flywheel returns its energy to the transmission, saving much of the braking energy that would otherwise have been wasted. It uses the stored energy to power an electric motor which helps accelerate the bus back up to speed, generating fuel savings of more than 20% at a significantly lower cost than batter y hybrid alternatives"	Intellectual

Risks are monitored on an ongoing basis through our risk management processes and are mitigated through the internal control environment. Residual risks are assessed and it is determined whether they will be accepted as an integral par t of the business, or deemed unacceptable and therefore either reduced, transferred to third par ties or avoided by no longer pursuing the relevant activities. We are always looking at ways to develop and improve our risk management processes.

Through monthly meetings with the senior management of each operating company, the executive directors encourage open bottom-up communication on risk matters within a clearly defined framework and repor ting process.

At times when public transpor t is disrupted, our operating companies’ websites can have tens of thousands of people looking for information at the same time.

"With more and more people accessing the information on the move,  it is critical that our operating company sites are resilient and can withstand large surges of people accessing them at any one time. In the past we have learnt our websites and ser vers can be par ticularly vulnerable when external forces beyond our control, such as the weather, cause major disruption. In 2010, heavy snowfall stopping rail ser vices in the south east of the UK resulted in an unprecedented number of people accessing our rail websites causing ser vers to ‘crash’ and resulting in information being unavailable. Since then, we have focused our effor ts on mitigating the risk of this happening again and now believe we are leading the industr y in our approach to website resilience and business continuity"	Unclassified

We use external companies to conduct site confidence testing ever y year, to assess whether our systems are able  to cope if there is an unprecedented increase in users needing access. Working together with our suppliers and across our operating companies, we monitor and respond to incidents quickly, minimising the risk of information being unavailable.We also need to continually stay abreast of how use of technology  is changing so we can continue to provide our customers with the information they need at a time, and in a way that suits them.
